Venue:Eludamos  
Abstract:the majority of videogames as they are currently constituted seem to display a mechanistic repetitiveness in conception development and production a creative shallowness in games a lack of innovation and a tendency to clone successful titles are in part attributable to the hegemonic control exerted by game producers this situation persists despite the intense frustration from the creative talent within the industry design documents are worked out by the marketing department effectively as an artist or programmer you do what you re told wade 2007 p 687 this article approaches fantasy as an underlying structuring element capable of energising the creative evolution of video games fantasy is interpreted as persisting throughout all game forms and not confined to its own recognisable genre

Venue:Edutainment  
Abstract:this paper describes a computational approach to style conversion of cartoon animation our system works in two stages the internal color shading phase in which characters painted by the conventional method are segmented into their constituent regions and edges first textures painted using different media are then added to the identified regions and the line rendering phase in which curvature of edges detected during the first phase is calculated and used to pick up turning points from edges strokes with defined shapes and textures are then placed in the positions determined by turning points along the contour as well as internal lines of characters our system obviates the tedium of creating more expressive rendering by hand and keeps frame to frame coherence in the resultant animations

Abstract:in 2004 botea et al published the hpa algorithm hierarchical pathfinding a which is the first detailed study of hierarchical pathfinding in games however hpa can be optimized in this paper we introduce the dhpa and shpa hierarchical pathfinding algorithms along with a metric for comparing the dynamic performance of pathfinding algorithms in games we show that dhpa searches up to an order of magnitude faster than hpa but consumes significantly more memory and produces slightly less optimal paths the shpa algorithm searches up to five times faster than hpa and consumes less memory but it also produces slightly less optimal paths and is only fit for static environments when comparing the algorithms in dynamic environments our results show that dhpa often outperforms hpa unlike many other hierarchical pathfinding algorithms both solutions presented in this paper maintain a read only terrain representation during search which simplifies programming and debugging and improves multithreaded performance

Abstract:overrun by monsters and tyrants and ravaged by fanaticism excess and greed world of warcraft offers players a chance to struggle metaphorically against that which oppresses them the excesses of late capitalism as they are represented by the game s spectacular antagonisms in order to take advantage of this opportunity however players must employ the very thing through which their oppression is manifested interpellated into the game as fetishized images players must construct themselves and function in accordance with the limitations imposed upon them by the race and class of their characters players as such are incorporated into world of warcraft s spectacle even as they struggle against it what world of warcraft sells players is thus not liberation and fulfillment but more of the same a spectacular version of the present tense in which the race and class based antagonisms that define the status quo of late capitalism are represented as magical and fantastic in approaching world of warcraft in these terms this article attempts to understand how the game commodifies struggle not only securing the consent of players to produce themselves and perform as subjects but in doing so reproducing the illusion in which the society of world of warcraft s spectacle is manifested the illusion that the spectacular hierarchies and inequalities of late capitalism are natural and inevitable rather than socially constructed

Venue:IJCGT  
Abstract:this paper is part of an experimental approach aimed to raise a videogames classification being inspired by the methodology that propp used for the classification of russian fairy tales we have identified recurrent diagrams within rules of videogames that we called gameplay bricks the combinations of these different bricks should allow us to represent a classification of all videogames in accordance with their rules in this article we will study the nature of these bricks especially the link they seem to have with two types of game rules the rules that allow the player to manipulate the elements of the game and the rules defining the goal of the game this study will lead to an hypothesis about the nature of gameplay

Venue:Eludamos  
Abstract:even in a discipline as young as game studies ignoring for a moment the increasingly popular further differentiation between ludologists and narratologists 1 it has become impossible to account for every approach concerning methodology for the study of digital games for precisely that reason it is important to be aware that the better part of academic literature is published and debated online new techniques of archival storage faster reaction times and a far greater transience of the contributions shape the flow and crystallization of gaming theories i will thus critically comment on a selection of texts and examples displaying current notions in game analysis

Venue:Eludamos  
Abstract:this paper poses the question how has game recording evolved over the generations and how will it affect future generations of players and game developers who have access to the digital past high scores have a history behind them and as generations of games have moved forward they begin to record much more than just scores the present player generation can record complete replays of their entire gameplay performances and even play against other recorded player ghosts as the future generations of gamers and developers take over they will have unprecedented access to the digital history archive as it becomes easier and easier to record and store the past deciding what to do with that past will be the next generation s task as games move into the future

Venue:Eludamos  
Abstract:this article presents some thoughts on the forms and functions of hidden knowledge in popular strategy games it concentrates specifically on discourses of geopolitical thinking to argue that actual games use and reproduce specific forms of a geographical and political knowledge which are both deeply connected to the ideas of an extreme national and political thinking of the early 20th century and form a way of describing globalized forms of order policy and conflict exposing this idea will take a three step approach first the close linkage between strategy games and spatial concepts in general needs to be examined second some structural arguments of classical geopolitics of the 1920s to 1960s in contemporary strategy games must be revealed finally this text refers to current booms and renaissances of such geopolitical discourses in short this article tries to show how politics are coded as actions in space and how the german lebensraum policy is connected to samuel huntington s clash of civilization via age of empires

Venue:ACE  
Abstract:emulation is one of the most important methods for providing lower compatibilities and several game machines truly adopt emulations a game emulator establishes executions of the games of its target machine at the same time when we append a new function on an emulator we can apply the function for all games on the emulator actually many game emulators adopt extra functions and we gain many benefits from these functions these functions sometimes bridge the gaps between recent games and retro games however these functions leave rooms for improvements we implemented and evaluated undo function as an example of the improvements this function removed the problems of the traditional function and achieved performance gains from the traditional except when we fully engaged in the traditional function our function considerably reduced the penalties of the failures in games in addition our function also homogenized the penalties without dedications we can use our function easily and safely

Venue:ICEC  
Abstract:autonomous synthetic actors must invent variations of known material in order to perform given only a limited script and to assist the director with development of the performance in addition the synthetic actors need to learn through the rehearsal process as their human counterparts do via feedback from the director through the production of two performances involving both human and synthetic actors a variety of methods of creating extemporaneous performance and utilising feedback to select the most effective performance variations will be examined one method of varying the performance is the manner in which lines of dialogue are delivered the paper outlines use of a statistical technique to create three variations of a performance each variation was then ranked and these rankings used to weight the variances in individual lines to create a superior variation this allowed quick evaluation of many lines without having to score each individual line

Venue:SGDA  
Abstract:vision and auditory channels are often used to convey information quickly knowing that hearing and vision are generally loaded with plenty of stimuli the use of touch as an alternative medium of communication could unload those senses although many studies have been conducted on hapic icons or tactile icons few of them have focused on the foot as a medium of communication this paper particularly investigate the maximum number of vibrotactile messages that could be memorized when displayed under the foot the method is based on a daily training wrapped in a serious game in the latter the avatar must be led to different locations through risky path risky events are displayed along the route through vibrotactile feedbacks which have to be identified by the player a preliminary experiment shows the usability of this serious game for learning a large number of vibrotactile stimuli


546af8e1ba4fc60c4b161b86 Title:real boys carry girly epics normalising gender bending in online games
Venue:Eludamos  
Abstract:players in online games frequently choose the opposite gender when they select an avatar previously this has been attributed to a player s unconscious sexual anxieties and the need to experiment through the anonymous location of the avatar however this paper argues that the development of choice in games where players have frequently selected the female form for ludic reasons means that this choice has become normalised through a historical process the avatar is frequently considered as a tool with gender regarded as a freely admitted aesthetic pleasure the player does not see this as a site of tension or seeks to absolve this tension publicly as an act of appropriation typical to jenkins? textual poachers overall the act of gender switching is not considered deviant within gaming more it is embraced as a common practise with historical precedents to support it

Venue:The Philosophy of Computer Games  
Abstract:the simulacrum far from being a new foundation it engulfs all foundations it assures an universal breakdown but as a joyful and positive event as an unfounding behind each cave another that opens still more deeply and beyond each surface a subterranean world yet more vast more strange richer still and under all foundations under every ground a subsoil still more profound the video games transgress in the majority of cases unknowingly or while attempting to reproduce the different conceptions of the identities found throughout the history of philosophy from the being thrown into the world geworfenheit to the being towards death sein zum tode video games set forth a new type of identity consciously created that unlike the presumed essential identity can always be transgressed dismantled and put back together this presumed essential identity has carried enormous problems and philosophical contradictions like social conceptions that given rise to discriminatory politics racist sexist and classist being aware of the political force the simulacrum can entail we want to undertake a cartesian adventure of course perverting its origin if descartes intended to find a secure foundation for science and with this purpose in the peaceful retreat of his home next to the hearth he trod the path that led him to the methodic doubt we among the hustle and bustle of the city and bathed in the light of a screen prepare ourselves to hit all those foundations that descartes hit himself using the doubt but our aim far from seeking an indubitable truth inside the conscience will not go beyond the pleasure of doubt itself we propose five simulacra that operate in video games and open the path to spaces for the experimentation and creation of identities simulacra that will shake the sense of oneself and allow us to assert the existence of some kind of self gamer an analysis of and experimentation with these simulacra could lead us to new conceptions of the self outside the context of video games that we hope will help impulse the imaging of emancipatory social structures and policies you can take this as a crazy and desperate experiment carried out by those who searching for meaning had no option but creating a new one

Abstract:this paper aims to identify an understanding of digital games in virtual environments1 by using don ihde s 1990 postphenomenological approach to how technology mediates the world to human beings in conjunction with hans georg gadamer s 1993 notion of play2 through this tentatively proposed amalgamation of theories i point towards an alternative understanding of the relationship between play and game as not only dialectic but also as socially and ethically relevant qua the design and implementation of the game as technology at first i outline ihde s concept of hermeneutical technological mediation and apply it to digital games as technology considering that such an application of concepts to digital games requires a working definition of play i subsequently draw upon gadamer s notion of play to further understand the relationship between players3 and digital games as technology consequently i propose an adjusted view on how digital games as technology mediate the world to their players given gadamer s dialectic notion of play along with the implications of the paper s proposal finally i outline potential objections and future directions of analysis and research for the proposed concepts although it is a challenge to merge these two different theories without doing injustice to their respective concepts it is my assessment that the theories indicate a potentially rich way of understanding the activity of play through technology 4 thus this paper should be regarded as a theoretical compliment or contribution to how we approach complex phenomena like play and game and their dialectic relationship

Venue:Edutainment  
Abstract:a narrow band based adaptive level set method is proposed for mesh evolution in this paper in the preprocessing step the portions of the mesh with high curvature are detected and clustered as fine geometric details then the fine grids with optimal orientations are defined for each detected portions while the coarse grid is chosen for global evolution the solutions on different scale grids are synthesized as the final results compared with the level set solution on the uniform grid our approach can achieve a good compromise between computational costs and mesh evolution quality the implementation results also show that it is an efficient and robust method

Venue:Edutainment  
Abstract:in this paper we present a novel interactive texture design scheme based on the tile optimization and image composition given a small example texture the design process starts with applying an optimized sample patches selection operation to the example texture to obtain a set of sample patches then a set of ω tiles are constructed from these patches local changes to those tiles are further made by composing their local regions with the texture elements or objects interactively selected from other textures or normal images such select compose process is iterated many times until the desired ω tiles are obtained finally the tiles are tiled together to form a large texture our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique can be used for designing a large variety of versatile textures from a single small example texture increasing or decreasing the decreasing the density of texture elements as well as for synthesizing textures from multiple sources
