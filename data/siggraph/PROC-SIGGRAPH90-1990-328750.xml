 Grand Challenges of Computational Science Chair Larry Smarr NCSA Panelists Gregory McRae Carnegie Mellon 
University David Dixon E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &#38; Co. Eric Lander MIT There has been a massive expansion 
in the computa- tional infrastructure supporting scientific research in the last five years. Today tens 
of thousands of researchers have access from their desktop computers to supercomputer centers over the 
national network. Scientific visualization has arisen as a critical tool of discovery, analysis and communication; 
fundamen- tal research problems with economic or scientific impact are being attacked. Leading researchers 
discuss how advanced computing and visualization resources are used to advance knowledge on these problems 
in university, industrial, and governmental research centers. They explain the White House's High Performance 
Computing Program, a $500 million annual program for computer and technology research and development. 
Larry Smarr Welcome to the SIGGRAPH Panel on Grand Challenges of Computational Science. I think I want 
to go ahead and get started because we have a lot of very exciting material to get through today and 
I want to give plenty of time for questions at the end of the panelist presenta- tion. If you can hold 
your questions until then, we'll take them on the entire set of talks. I've been asked by the SIGGRAPH 
people in charge of panels to remind you of a few house- keeping details. There will be a breakout session 
afterwards if there are still people that want to talk for a little bit in $412 upstairs. This session 
will go until 12:30. We will try to leave some- thing like 20 minutes to a half an hour of time at the 
end for questions. There is no audio, video or taping or still photography allowed by SIGGRAPH of this 
event. There will be a tran- script prepared which will be available in the SIGGRAPH printed collection 
-- and it is being videotaped. There is a National Center for Supercomputing Applications press packet 
in the press room with individual -- one individual slide and a little bit of write-up on each of the 
panelist area -- or at least on some of the panelist areas. There is a companion panel which will go 
into more detail on the legislative agenda and the politics of the high performance computing initiative 
which Donna Cox will be chairing. That will be on Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 10:30 in this theater. I will 
also be a part of that panel and it will get into much more of the very, very rapid pace of activity 
in this particular area that is going on now in Washington. This is a very hot topic and that's the reason 
we wanted to have this panel. I'm thrilled actually that we were able to get the three speakers here 
to join us. Art Freeman, who is on the program became ill at the very last minute. He called in last 
night and was not able to join us. Dave Dixon will be covering his material on materials during his presentation. 
I'll introduce briefly the three panelists. First, l guess I should introduce myself; I'm Larry Smarr. 
I'm a physicist -- an astrophysicist and I'm the director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign --one of the National Science Foundation supercomputer 
centers. The panelists have been put together with the following qualifications. They had to be abso- 
lutely recognized as one of the forefront re- searchers in their field by their community --by their 
colleagues. And they had to also be actively involved in public policy issues engaged with the various 
entities in the science policy arena. We have achieved that goal. These people are absolutely first-rate. 
It's a real treat, I think at SIGGRAPH to have scientists share with you what the scientific visualization 
and corn- Grand Challenges of Computational Science   Grand Challenges of ComputationalScience COMPUTATIONAL 
SCIENTIST / '%O.,T.M~.EO.Y l Oa{a Archive Visualization work. What he needs to be able to do --and here 
he sits in the center --is to have access to hardware. Well, he can't just have access to a fast CPU. 
That's what the teraflop mission is basically focused on. It has to actually focus on a much more balanced 
machine. He needs large memory devices. He also needs very large amounts of scratch disk and storage 
devices so he can store the data that's actually computed. If you run 50 hours on a supercomputer at 
today's costs, you can't afford to throw that data away and not be able to use it later. You also have 
to have appropriate software and one of the things that's really made numeri- cal simulation possible 
over the last few years has been the ability to have things such as high quality operating systems, good 
compilers and also very good programs that have actually been made accessible for the user to be able 
to do his computations. We now look at what's available for you to support. There are two areas that 
are very important here. One is the visualization which has been the focus of most of what SIGGRAPH is 
interested in. There is also a very large amount of work that has to go into how do we actually archive 
all of this data, and how can we actually access it. Finally, we have to have the people who develop 
the algorithms and the new theoretical models. One of the important things that has hap- pened is that 
this field is really becoming very, very strong again -- especially at least in the areas that I'm familiar 
with in computational chemistry --because we now have supercomputers. When you couldn't calculate anything 
that was very big and didn't really interest very many chemists, there really wasn't much reason to actually 
develop new methods. It's turned out in the last 10 years because of the availability of supercomputers 
that there have been dramatic new developments in algorithmic methods and in theoretical methods. On 
the next slide, let's look what any basic user in say an industrial environment wants to do. What he 
wants to do is access a set of data, and where does this data come from? Well, it can come from measurement. 
That's sort of been the traditional way. But now we can I MEASURE I ~ I COMPUTE I also compute the data 
or it may come from an internal data base or it may come from an external data base. It's this access 
to data that's really going to dramatically change how people do their work. On the next slide, let's 
look at what the actual weak link is and the weak link is really not how you measure, calculate or access 
the data from a data base, but how does the user interface with the data. And this is where we would 
hope that there can be dramatic changes in terms of the way people who develop graphical techniques can 
help the user, the generic user who is not an expert in any area of computing. They're not an WEAK LINK 
Data Browser i I ~ Visualization Data Modifier Data Access Generic User is not an Expert in any area 
of computing expert in mathematics, they are an expert in their own area of science. What they want to 
be able to do is access data. They want to be able to have graphical data browsers, a graphical data 
modifier, visualization and then they also need to actually find out what data is there and how can they 
actually get at it. All of this can be really enhanced by having very good graphical interfaces, and 
it's critical for the actual users who aren't computa- tional scientists to be able to have this kind 
of access. On the next slide, what is the value for numerical simulation? Well, there are two real values. 
The first, and it has really made a big difference by validating the techniques, has been accurate numerical 
prediction. We want to be able to reliably calculate the properties --in our case of molecules --for 
use by experimentalists.  Grand Challenges of Computational Science NCSA. We'll be looking at how the 
bonding between a chromium and a chloride ion devel- ops. Could you turn the volume up, please? <Video 
being played > The people who are associated with this work are given here. There are people from AMOCO, 
NCSA, Michigan State, and Northwestern. The first set of sequences you saw was actually done using ab 
initio quantum chemistry using molecular orbital theory, and the second set was actually done with the 
density functional method using the program DMol, which is a new technique that's now being applied to 
molecular systems. Thank you very much for that video. On the next slide, what we're going to be talking 
about now is an example from Du Pont of how we actually integrate computational science through one product 
line, and this is an important product line for us. This line is the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) line. Everybody 
is aware of the problems of CFCs in terms of looking at ozone depletion, and what we're looking at now 
is how we can actually use com- putational science to study this problem The problem here is that experimental 
data is lacking. For the available materials that contain one or two carbons, only about 30% of the Role 
of Computational Science for CFC Replacements Experimentaldata Is iacklng Reaction Enorg~e$ experimental 
data is available. Yet we need this data if we're actually going to be doing quantita- tive experiments 
and calculations. What we need to do first is be able to predict reaction energies for designing the 
catalyst and that's what we need for the research part. When you look at heat release from a chemical 
reac- tion, we impact development, process design and optimization of plant design. These are critical 
because we have to keep the costs down so that the cost of your air conditioning systems or your home 
refrigeration systems, doesn't get out of hand. And we're trying to do this in the most cost-effective 
way so we need simulations in order to do this. It's not just this basic level that we need the results 
of simulations, but as shown on the next slide, it actually integrates all the way down into marketing 
where we're using molecular graphics Role of Corn lionaf Sdenco f¢¢ F ~ ExpeHmenLaldoll Ii I~klr~; I 
to aid in marketing these materials. We need to look at customer product support, where we're predicting 
various properties of the molecules. We can calculate the intensity of the infrared absorption for global 
warming because we can't just worry about ozone depletion We also have to worry about the global warming 
potential of any of these compounds. Finally, we can actually use these techniques to study fluid environmental 
models in order to look at how we would dispose of waste fluids for some of the systems that we're looking 
at. So this actually shows that we go from the molecular level all the way down to the very long time-scale 
environmental level. The important point in these last two areas involving the environment is that we 
cannot do any experiments here. We can't go 50 to 10,000 years out and do an experiment and see what 
the materials are going to do. We have to do these simulations on the computer if we're going to make 
any progress at all in terms of providing information for the environmental models for both regulatory 
approval and for public accep- tance of these new materials. On the next slide -- what are the cost benefits 
of doing a simulation? To do one measurement of one alternate at NIST, which is the old NBS, would cost 
us about $50,000. The calculations Benefits of Numericat Simulation for CFC Atternates Program Cost 
benefi~e  Measurement for one alternate at NIST - $50M  -Calculation for one alternate - $2-5M Time

systems -Refrigerant properties actually cost us between two and five thousand dollars So they're about 
in order of magnitude cheaper than doing the experiment. But some- thing more important is that if we're 
going to do it at NIST, it would take about three months to f          Grand Challenges of 
ComputationalScience Japanese and the Germans, for example, are producing. They're probably outproducing 
us in a number of areas, for example, the Europeans in computational chemistry, and the people they produce 
are especially good at knowing how to really get very good numbers. There are quite a few people being 
produced in the biological molecular dynamics areas for chemical systems in the U.S., but in the hard 
core computational side there are not that many. So trained people are obviously something that we're 
going to need. It's also true in engineering. We didn't really cover all that much of that discipline 
here, but there aren't that many engineers being trained at the college level in computational science. 
There are very few Ph.D. engineers produced in the U.S. who would go into industry. We tend to hire mostly 
people with bachelors or masters degrees. We have to train them how to do computational science. We need 
to do that much earlier in the educational system. Another area that I think that is really critical, 
for this community especially, is we have to introduce the idea of scientific visualization and computer 
graphics into courses throughout all of the disciplines. We need to be introducing this not only into 
the computer science, but we need to have courses where we're integrating this into chemistry courses, 
physics courses, geology, biology and so forth, at the undergraduate level. That's an area that we have 
not really as any kind of community focused on. Computer graphics is something that's "gee whiz", "it's 
special", "it's too hard". But there are a lot of basic ideas that if we get them across to the students, 
would make a big difference in terms of what we will have down the road in 10 and 20 years. It's going 
to be critical that we integrate the visualization, the computer graphics, and the ability to get good 
numbers out if we're really going to solve problems in the U.S. to keep it competitive. Another area 
that I think is important is that you can't neglect the hardware side of things. We're all going to continue 
to buy it. I would certainly not want to be recommending on a policy issue that says well, we dump it 
all into people resources and we don't provide them with any computer resources, because if there are 
no computer resources, we're not going to be developing anything. So there has to be a balance between 
develop- ing the people, between making sure that there is hardware available for them through the various 
centers and so forth, especially at the universities, and also we have to make sure that we're going 
to allow people to not only develop the algorithms, which is fine, but if they don't implement them in 
code that I can use, I'm out of business. At the cost of one scientist, which is roughly a third of a 
million dollars a person in Du Pont Research, I don't have time to sit there and spend five years developing 
code --espe- cially if it's 100,000 lines that only I can use and maintain. So it's very important that 
we take this algorithm development and make it into usable code and then we have to provide really first 
rate, front end and back end interfaces. The front ends are coming along pretty well for a lot of these 
things. The analysis packages are really lacking and I think again that's an enormous area that can be 
attacked by the graphics community. Smarr Thank you. Next question? Q. Ben Bacon, Computers in Physics. 
There are, from a number of new computational methodologies that get loosely lumped under the name of 
chaos, and at AIP it's very controversial right now as to what sort of credence to give this. We're seeing 
an explosion in the submission rate of papers. Based upon such methodologies, would the members of this 
very distinguished panel like to take a crack at assessing the relative importance of these techniques 
in your various specialties? Dixon I'll try and start because we actually have a couple of areas where 
I think it's relevant. We've actually found chaotic behavior in industrial applications; chaos is here 
to stay. It's a different kind of solution space for a set of differential equations. So of course it's 
going to be impor- tant I think in a number of areas. Speaking specifically about chemical engineering 
applica- tions in a plant process system, we've actually found these kinds of things going on in some 
of our oxidation systems. So chaotic behavior potentially can have a very strong business impact if one 
wants to optimize a process. If your process is running in the chaotic regime, you have to make sure 
you understand that so you can run it optimally. It's still a basic area of research. It's only really 
been around as a well-defined area for 10 or 15 years, and I think that it's too soon to say what all 
the practical implications are going to be, but there clearly are going to be some. It is basically rethinking 
the kinds of solution spaces one has for very complex sets of differential equations. Lander I think 
in biology it's at an earlier stage still than that. Mostly for our inability to collect large amounts 
of data points and well define a system. But there are some areas where chaotic dynamics are beginning 
to be applied with actual experi- mental verification out the other end. Those pertain to things like 
heart attacks, epileptic attacks, epileptic fits in the brain, and to some work with neural networks. 
Remember, in his situation, he's got far better defined equations governing the vessel contain- ing what's 
going on --we don't. And so we have to do a fair bit more simulation of what may be going on, and then 
to actually believe that, we've got to come up with experimentally testable predictions. That's beginning 
to happen, although 1 think at our primitive stage it would be fair to say it's a small impact on the 
field and a much smaller impact that I suspect eventually will come as we get better descrip- tions. 
McRae I'd just like to make two very quick comments. I think that there's a lot of interesting mathemat- 
ics in chaos. The real issue is how do you get your knowledge of the physics into a lot of the formalisms 
that are being present. Since I work in climate kinds of issues. You see lots of discussions that maybe 
the climatic system is chaotic. What's typically missing from the many, many papers that I have read 
in this area is that the climate system is a forced damped system. It's forced by the sun and there's 
damping dissipational processes which we move the energy and radiate it back out into space. A lot of 
the mathematics papers that you read do not typically include damping and that really can change the 
modes of behavior of a system. The second comment that I'd make is that one of the conclusions that a 
lot of these papers reach is that if a system is chaotic you can't predict what's going on or alternatively 
if you can't predict what's going on, then you shouldn't do anything about the system. I think this is 
a good example of where we need to really rethink our approaches to algorithms because uncertainly is 
endemic in essentially every one of the problems that we've talked about today. In the past we've been 
--I would characterize -- victims of uncertainty. What we need to do is to think about how do we actually 
push through these complex models, notions of uncertainty --uncertainties in parameter variables -- and 
begin in the case of public policy for environmental problems, think about the development and design 
of robust strategies -- strategies which allow you to get the sign right even in the presence of lots 
of uncertainties. So I would characterize the field right now as being relatively immature in terms of 
how it actually might help us solve real problems. But that's not to say that any time we bring new mathematics 
that we don't get more descriptive power. Smarr I've just been advised that we need to terminate this 
discussion with maybe one more quick question and then we can move upstairs to continue it in S412 because 
these guys back here have got to get ready for the next thing. Yes, you were waiting next. Q. Burt Freedhoff, 
University of California. From the sound of things, one might get the impression that computational science 
and visualization are the same. And I wondered whether any of the members of the panel would want to 
comment on whether there's a role of computational science without visualization, what the connection 
between them. Smarr I'll just make a brief answer to that. The ques- tion is the difference between computational 
science and scientific visualization. It is true that a great deal of computational science -- the use 
of computers to explore science -- is done without visualization. And in fact, the largest uses of supercomputers 
today are for lattice gauge theory --elementary particle theory --in which no visualization of any sort 
is done. When you give scientific visualization tools to scientists in any field, they almost invariably 
find ways to look at their data that they had not looked at before, and they come to rely on the scientific 
visualization as both a discovery and an analytic process, which we've tried to explore here. So a great 
deal of it is that the scientific community is very poor. What you see out on the floor here has very 
little relation to what the average scientist has on his desk. And this is one of the things that's got 
to change. Because visualization basically should take place in the privacy of your own room, with you 
interacting with it, and that's what we'd like to move toward with the desktop wired in to these larger 
resources in the national centers. And at that point, because we're very visual animals, scien- tific 
visualization will become a dominant part of the scientific method. Thank you very much for your attention. 
Let's thank the speakers again and then those who would like to move up can do that. Grand Challenges 
of Computational Science
