Richard P. Sonderegger, Jr. Engineering Publications Department Data General Corporation Southboro, Massachusetts 
 After experiments with more traditional editors, TYPER, an editor designed specifically for the online 
composition and editing of text, was developed. TYPER uses the 20 lines of a CRT terminal screen to implement 
a window onto the writer's text that can be moved at will. All normal typewriter functions are available 
plus special functions for the easy insertion, deletion, and modification of text. A non-destructive 
cursor can be moved about the screen and acts as a pointer to the text. Any printable character typed 
is immediately placed in the text at the position indicated by the cursor and the change is reflected 
on the screen. Insertion and deletion of text is accomplished with simple keystrokes. After an insertion 
or deletion, any extra space between words and space at the end of short lines is filled by "closing" 
the text. Successive words are placed so that they are separated by one space and extra space at the 
end of a line is filled with words from the succeeding line. Response to TYPER has been excellent. Non-programmers 
and even those with no computer experience learn its use quickly and are loath to go back to typewriters 
after using it. In addition, programmers are using it to edit their program code. 1. INTRODUCTION felt 
that this system should consist of a text entry/editing program, a text formatting The Engineering Publications

now exists and consists of an editor, called TYPER; a text formatter, called SCRIPT; In the early days 
of the department, the and an online, computer driven phototypesetter. traditional method of producing 
and updating TYPER, SCRIPT, and the phototypesetter manuals was used. Writers wrote their drafts in software 
were written by members of this longhand or on typewriters. These drafts were department. The typesetter

text editor, TYPER. production staff. The completed masters were printed by our in-house print shop. 
Later updates were performed in the same manner. 2. OTHER EDITORS As the company grew and the Engineering 
Rather than reinvent the wheel, we went looking department became more prolific, more manuals for a text 
entry program that would meet our were required. Updates of past manuals to reflect needs. Data General 
offers two editors as part of changes and upgrades to current equipment their standard software: EDIT 
and SUPEREDIT. became more important. It became obvious to all These are character oriented editors and 
operate members of our department that an integrated, in much the same manner as TECO, a product of online 
text processing system was required. We Digital Equipment Corporation. 1 We felt that these editors 
were unacceptable for several reasons. People who are not programmers take a long time understanding 
their operation and are not particularly interested in the intricacies of macros, registers, and holding 
buffers. Relatively simple operations require the writer to type long strings of seemingly unrelated 
characters. Rough text comes out scattered with some long lines and many short lines. Because these editors 
are basically teletypewriter oriented, the writer is forced to pick his way through his text one line 
at a time. It is difficult to point to a character or word and change it without thinking about the primative 
operations required. in short, the operation of these editors is not intuitive. While they are quite 
powerful, the power offered is not of the kind required to compose and edit text. The major design goal 
of TYPER was to make the production and updating of text simple for a non-programmer. This meant that 
as many operations as possible should be accomplished intuitively without requiring the writer to worry 
about the primitive operations involved. Certain text oriented operations such as closing up short lines 
should be performed automatically. The creation of backup files should be accomplished as a matter of 
course by the program. It should be extremely difficult for a writer to inadvertantly destroy his text. 
The next design goal was to use DGC standard hardware. Since all the computers produced by DGC are instruction 
set compatible, we did not have to pick a specific processor. Likewise, all the different online storage 
devices are compatible, so we were at liberty to use whatever tape and disc drives were available. The 
only specific equipment choice that we had to make was what terminal to use. The choice was between Teletypes 
and Pnfoton Vista Standard CRT terminals. We picked the latter on the basis of silence, speed, and the 
fact that a CRT could show the writer exactly what was happening to his text. In addition, an editor 
that used a CRT could use the graphic capabilities inherent in such a terminal to make the editing of 
text an intuitive process. The third design goal was to allow the use of standard software if desired. 
This meant that the format of the file created by the editor had to be the same as those files created 
by EDIT and SUPEREDIT. This would allow the use of operating system utilities to print the files and 
TYPER is written in Data General Extended move them around the system. In addition, the writer would 
be able to use the power of EDIT and SUPEREDIT if he wanted to. ALGOL which is a superset of ALGOL 60. 
TYPER will run on any NOVA or ECLIPSE based computer system that contains at least one disc drive and 
at least 32K words of main memory. The program runs under both operating systems offered by Data General: 
the Real-time Disc Operating System (RDOS) and the Mapped Real-time Disc Operating System (MRDOS). There 
are two concepts which are central to the operation of TYPER. One is the fact that the text displayed 
on the screen is an accurate representation of the text in the computer s memory. Any change made to 
the text in memory is immediately made to the text on the screen. The text stored on disc is not updated 
until termination of the editing session. The second concept is that of closing text. The close function 
reformats text by placing as many complete words as possible on each line. Extra space between two words 
is deleted by sliding the right-hand word left until only one space separates the words. If the left-hand 
word has a full-stop character (period, question mark, exclamation point, or colon) as its last character, 
two spaces are left between those two words. Space created at the end of a line is filled with as many 
complete words from the next line as possible. Text remaining on the next line is slid over to the left-hand 
margin and the process is repeated. This process continues to the end of the current paragraph. A new 
paragraph is assumed to start when a line is found that begins with at least one space. This is an example 
of uric losed text. Note that there are many holes in the text and the Lines are of greatly differing 
length. This line starts a eY paragraph and will not be closed. EXAMPLE OF UNCLOSED TEXT This is an 
example of unclosed text. Note that there are many holes in the text and the lines are of greatly differing 
length. This line starts a new paragraph and vi11 not be closed. EXAMPLE OF SAME TEXT CLOSED TYPER uses 
the 20 lines of the CRT to implement a window onto the text contained in the writer's file. This window 
may be moved up and down over the text as if the writer were sitting at a typewriter equipped with an 
endless roll of paper. The writer has many of the standard typewriter features available such as setting 
and clearing tabs, and control over upper and lower case letters. The position of the cursor on the screen 
reflects the position of the cursor in the text. It is helpful to think of the cursor as analogous to 
the moving type element on a fixed carraige typewriter such as the IBM Selectric. The cursor may be moved 
at will through the use of the standard cursor movement commands (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, HOME). Typing 
a TAB character moves the cursor to the next tab stop to the right or to the right margin if there are 
no more tab stops. Typing a RETURN character moves the cursor down one line and over to the left margin 
on that line. Typing a LINE FEED character is equivalent to typing a CURSOR DOWN. If the cursor is on 
the bottom line of the screen when a CURSOR DOWN, RETURN, or LINE FEED character is typed, the 20-line 
window is rolled down one line on the text and the next line of text becomes visible on the bottom line 
of the screen. If the cursor is on the top line of the screen and a CURSOR UP character is typed, the 
20-line window is rolled up one line on the text and the previous line of text becomes visible on the 
top line of the screen. The entire window may be rolled forward or backward 20 lines at a time by typing 
one key combination for forward and a different key combination for backward. As any of the 95 printable 
characters is typed, that character is placed in the text and on the screen at the position of the cursor, 
and the cursor is moved one position to the right. This means that correction of a simple typographical 
error is accomplished by moving the cursor to the mistyped letter and typing the correct letter. Another 
way of correcting a typing mistake is through the use of the RUBOUT key. Each time the RUBOUT key is 
typed, the cursor moves one position to the left and puts a space in the text and on the screen at that 
spot. If the cursor is at the left-hand margin, RUBOUT has no effect. To facilitate touch typing, the 
carraige return function is performed automatically if the user tries to place a character beyond the 
right margin. In addition, if the user tries to type a word that will not fit on the current line, the 
portion of the word already typed will be transferred to the beginning of the next line when the user 
types the character in the margin. Insertion of text is accomplished by moving the cursor to the position 
that is to follow the inserted text and striking the ESCAPE key. The text on that line from the cursor 
position to the right margin and on all succeeding lines is pushed down one line, opening a blank spot 
on the screen. Text can then be typed in the blank spot. Any attempt to move the cursor down results 
in the text being pushed further down making multiple line inserts possible. The insertion is terminated 
by striking the ESCAPE key a second time. At this point, any blank space created by the pushing of the 
text, but not used by the insertion is reclaimed by closing the text from the end of the inserted text 
to the end of that paragraph. Deletion of text is accomplished by positioning the cursor at one end of 
the block of text to be deleted and striking a key combination. The writer then moves the cursor to the 
other end of the block and strikes the same key combination. The text in the block, including the end 
points, is deleted and space created is reclaimed by closing the text from the beginning of the space 
to the end of the paragraph. 4.1 Other Functions In addition to the insert and delete functions, various 
other functions which operate with a single keystroke are available to aid the writer in the editing 
of text. The single character insert function slides all characters on the line, from the present position 
of the cursor to the right-hand margin, one character to the right and places a space character at the 
present cursor position. The cursor does not move. The text is not closed. If the character at the right-hand 
margin is not a space, this function will have no effect. This function will not slide a word to the 
next line. This function is obviously useful for inserting a single character in a line, but its main 
use is in editing tables. Because the normal insert function closes the text when it is done, a carefully 
constructed piece of tabular text can be altered drastically by doing an insert in the middle of the 
table. The character insert function can be used in a table without worrying about the side effect of 
closing the text. The single character delete function slides all characters on the line, from the character 
one position to the right of the cursor to the right-hand margin, one character to the left. A space 
is placed in the vacated position at the right-hand margin. The cursor does not move. The text is not 
closed. Besides deleting a single character from a line of text, this function is useful when editing 
tables for the same reason as insert character. The duplicate field function copies the contents of the 
previous line, from the current horizontal position of the cursor to the next tab stop, onto the current 
line. The cursor moves to the next tab stop. The text is not closed. Many times when constructing tables, 
the same entry occurs on successive lines. This function makes typing these entries time after time unneccessary. 
 4.2 Input/Output TYPER is a paged editor. That is, when editing a file, the writer reads a page of text 
from the input file into main memory, modifies it, and then writes it out to the output file before reading 
in the next page. Single keystroke commands are available to read a page, write a page, get the next 
page (actually a write followed by a read), write a partial page, and transfer the remainder of the input 
file to the output file. The main memory buffer in TYPER is big enough to hold 120 lines of text. During 
reading, a page is considered to end when a line is read into line 60 or line 120 or a form feed character 
is encountered in the text; whichever comes first. During writing, a form feed is automatically placed 
at the end of each page unless the writer directs otherwise. The fact that the buffer is big enough to 
hold two pages allows the editing of text that crosses page boundries. The ability to write partial pages 
and to hold more than one page in main memory allows page boundries to be changed easily. 5. PLANNED 
ENHANCEMENTS The current version of TYPER is not the final one. We are still learning about what capabilities 
should be embodied in an editor that is oriented toward the composing and editing of text. A new version 
is currently under development and will be, we feel, significantly better than the current one.  5.1 
Endless Scrolling Because the current version of TYPER is a paged editor, once a page has been edited 
and written out of memory, it cannot be recalled without copying the remainder of the input file to the 
output file, ending the current editing session, and beginning another editing session from the beginning 
of the file. We plan to implement a mechanism whereby the writer can scroll forward and backward throughout 
his file without regard as to whether or not the section of text that he wants is currently in main memory. 
This will be done by building two "stack files" on disc and keeping only a small amount of the text in 
main memory at any one time. The amount of text kept in main memory will be equal to 3 screen's worth 
of text. For a 20-line display, this will be 60 lines of text and will be, in effect, a 60-line window 
onto the text file. The two stack files will be a "top stack" and a "bottom stack" and will be used to 
ensure that the 20 lines currently displayed on the screen are the middle 20 lines of the larger 60 line 
window. At the beginning of an editing session the top 20 lines of the memory window will be blank and 
the bottom 40 lines will be filled with the first 40 lines of text from the input file. If the writer 
moves the screen window up on the memory window, text is rolled off the bottom of the memory window into 
the bottom stack and the remaining text is moved down. If the writer moves the screen window down on 
the memory window, text is rolled off the top of the memory window into the top stack and the remaining 
text is moved up. The space created at the bottom of the memory window is filled with text from the bottom 
stack if there is any or with text from the input file.  All disc accessing and text moving will be 
performed after the screen is updated in order to "hide" this processing time. By keeping 3 screen's 
worth of text in main memory, the writer can slide the screen up or down a full 20 lines without having 
to wait for text to be rolled in and out of memory. If, after other enhancements have been added, we 
find that there is some main memory space still available, the size of the memory window will be expanded 
and disc accessing will only occur when the screen window moves on the memory window such that there 
is not a full screen's worth of text both above and below the screen window. Enough text will be rolled 
so that the screen window is in the middle of the memory window.  5.2 Search Facility Another major 
enhancement will be the addition of a search facility. We have found that writers do not keep track of 
how many pages there are in their files or of where the pages start and end. The task of searching visiually, 
page by page, for a desired word or phrase is a tedious one. Therefore, the ability to search for a string 
is a must. This facility will be implemented by adding a command mode to TYPER. A single keystroke will 
put the program in command mode. The cursor will move to the first position of the last line on the screen 
and that line will become blank. This will be the only time that the appearance of the screen does not 
reflect the state of the text. The writer will then type the command for search followed by the string 
that he wants to search for, followed by a carraige return. The cursor will return to the first position 
on the line and the search will begin. The search will begin at the point where the cursor was before 
the writer entered command mode and will continue until the string is found or until the end of the file 
is reached. If the string is found, the program will leave command mode, the screen window will be placed 
on the text so that the line containing the string is in the middle of the screen, and the cursor will 
be placed on the first character of the string. If the string is not found, the program will leave command 
mode, the screen window will be placed on the text so that the last line of text in the file is in the 
middle of the screen, and the cursor will be placed on the last character of that line. A message will 
be displayed in the blank space beneath the last line to the effect that the search was unsuccessful. 
 5.3 Move Facility The third major enhancement will be the addition of a facilty for moving blocks of 
text. Many times, the text that has been written is good, but the paragraphs are in the wrong order. 
Instead of having to retype the paragraphs in the right order, we want to have a facility for moving 
text around that makes changing the order of paragraphs as easy as changing a word. A single keystroke 
will be used to define the endpoints of a block. The block will include the endpoints. At any time, only 
one block may be defined. Once the block is defined, the writer may either move or copy the text to another 
point in the file, or he may move or copy it to a disc file. A move will transfer the text, delete it 
from the source position and close the created space. A copy will transfer the text, but leave it unchanged 
in the source position. To transfer the text to another point in the file, the writer will move the cursor 
to the position that is to follow the transferred text and strike one key combination for a move and 
a different key combination for a copy. The result at the destination point will be the same as if the 
text was inserted using the regular insert function. To transfer the text to a disc file, the writer 
will enter command mode, type the command followed by the name that the file is to receive, followed 
by a carraige return. After the transfer, the program will leave command mode and the cursor will return 
to its former position. To transfer text from a disc file to a certain point in the text, the writer 
will move the cursor to the position that is to follow the transferred text and then enter command mode. 
He will then type the command followed by the name of the desired file, followed by a carraige return. 
The result at the destination point will be the same as if the text was inserted using the regular insert 
function. After the transfer, the program will leave command mode and the cursor will return the point 
following the insert. 5.4 Other Additions The creation of a command mode brings up several interesting 
possibilities. Because a whole line is available and the procedure for entering and leaving command mode 
is well defined, we can probably do some things that could not be done before when all commands had to 
be single keystrokes A change command or iterative replace string for Second, programmers are using TYPER 
to string seems to be a logical outgrowth of the produce and update program code. They like the search 
facility. ability to see their changes in the context of the RDOS and MRDOS allow a program to suspend 
itself and return to monitor level with the ability to later re-enter the suspended program at the point 
at which it suspended itself. Implementing this in TYPER would allow the writer to leave an editing session, 
and do something else without having to begin another session from the beginning of the file. 5.5 New 
Language In the time since TYPER was originally written, Data General has implemented an in-house development 
language, called PL/N, that is a subset of PL/I. This language has many improvements over Data General 
Extended ALGOL in the area of increased run-time speed and decreased main memory requirements. We hope 
that gains in these areas can be translated into further extensions to TYPER and, therefore, to further 
benefits to our writers. 6. SIDE EFFECTS AND COMPLAINTS Two unexpected side effects of TYPER have been 
observed over the past two years. First, we have found that writers, after using TYPER for only a couple 
of days, have difficulty using regular typewriters. They get so used to the automatic carraige return 
that they constantly type right into the margin when confronted with a typewriter. The writers also find 
that the ease with which typographical errors can be changed is sorely missed. surrounding code. They 
also like the ease with which typographical errors are corrected. The major complaints which have been 
registered by TYPER users are: the inability to go backward in a file, the lack of a search command, 
the inability to move blocks of text, and the damage done to tables by the close function. The first 
three problems will be fixed in the next version of the program, but the problem of closing text within 
tables will remain. We feel that this is a trade-off and is something that the writers can live with. 
 7. CONCLUSIONS We believe that the development of TYPER has been worthwhile. Not only can programmers 
quickly learn the commands and functions, but non-programmers are able to use the program effectively 
with a minimum of training. Even though we have not advertised the program, word has carried through 
the company and we get requests daily for copies of it. The use of TYPER has lowered the time required 
to produce our documents. Writers are able to compose text more quickly and the drafts are more error-free 
due to the ease with which text may be produced. The use of TYPER has also increased the quality of our 
documents. Writers are more prone to massage their text because it is easy to do so. Since the mechanics 
of changing text are no longer difficult, the writers are much more prone to work over their text until 
is is "just right".

			<par><![CDATA[A new system, that of matrix grammars, for two-dimensional picture processing, is introduced. A hierarchy, induced on Chomsky's is found. Language operations such as union, catenation (row and column), Kleene's closure (row and column), and homomorphisms are investigated. It is found that the smallest class of these languages may serve as the class of arrays, which is defined as the smallest class of arrays closed under union, catenation (row and column) and Kleene's closure (row and column). Eight possible ways of defining a matrix language are discussed and it is suggested that one of them may lead to a normal form of matrix grammars. The method is advantageous over others on several points.

 SEQUENTIAL/PARALLELMATRIX PICTURE LANGUAGES Patrick Shen-PeiWang and William I. Grosky School of Information 
and Computer Science GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Atlanta Georgia 30332 ABSTRACT A new system, that 
of matrix grammars, for two-dimensionalpicture processing, is introduced. A hierarchy, induced on Chomsky's 
is found. Language operations such as union, catenation (row and column), Kleene's closure (row and column), 
and homomorphismsare investigated. It is found that the smallest class of these languages may serve as 
the class of arrays, which is defined as the smallest class of arrays closed under union, catenation 
(row and column) and Kleene's closure (row and column). Eight possible ways of defining a matrix language 
are discussed and it is suggested that one of them may lead to a normal form of matrix grammars. The 
method is advantageous over others on several points. Perhaps the most interesting of all is that it 
provides a compromise between purely sequential methods, which take too much time for large arrays and 
purely parallel methods, which usually take too much hardware for large arrays. In accordance with ACM 
publication policy, only an abstract of this paper appears in the Conference proceedings, since the paper 
is being considered for publication elsewhere. Pre-prints of the paper were distributed to Conferenceparticipants.

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania AN INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICSAPPROACH FOR DISSECTING A MIXTURE 
OF NORMAL (OR LOGNORMAL) DISTRIBUTIONS Richard B. McCammon U.S. Geological Survey National Center 
952 Reston, Va. 22092 An interactive computer graphics program has been developed to dissect mixtures 
of normal (or lognormal) distributions. The program incorporates both graphical and analytical techniques 
to obtain a more satisfactory solution totheproblem of dissection. Within a matter of minutes, a mixed 
frequency curve can be decomposed into its normal (or lognormal) components. A statistical summary following 
dissection makes it possible to evaluate the goodness-of-fitand the separability of the inferred subpopulations. 
Individual components can be added or subtracted and adjustments can be made to individualparameters 
of components. An example of dissection is given in geology and in sports. 1. BACKGROUND Most natural

and standard deviation of the distribution can be estimated from the position and slope of this line. 
In the case of a bimodal normal distribution,the cumulative frequency curve can be decomposed into two 
lines from which the mean and standard deviation can be estimated separately. The inflection point of 
the curve can be used to estimate the proportion of each population. This is illustrated in fig. 1. 
For mixed distributions involvinga small number of components, graphical techniques like those of Harding

In the field of geology these graphical techniques have been appliedto the dissection of mixed frequency

compare easily and quickly the theoretical distributions derived from different estimates of the parameters 
because of the considerable calculations required. Similarly it is difficult to evaluate goodness-of-fittests 
 quantitatively. Because of this, there is always uncertaintyassociated with results obtained graphically. 
 The difficulties described above in dissecting mixed distributions can be overcome by combining a graphical 
with an analytic approach. This can be accomplishedby interactive computer graphics and it is this 
approach which is described in this paper.  2. A COMBINED GRAPHICAL-ANALYTICAPPROACH In order to obtain 
a more satisfactory solution to the problem of dissectinga mixture of normal (or lognormal) distributions, 
a computer program was developed which combined the elements of graphics, an interactive environment, 
and high-speedcomputation. The program has been implemented on a storage tube type CRT terminal connected 
to a time share computer. It satifies the following ten requirements: 1) graphic display of observed 
 cumulative frequency curve plotted on arith­ metic (or logarithmic)probability scale, 2) graphic estimation 
of initial values of parameters, 3) selective display, erasure or deletion of graphic estimates, 4) 
selection of arbitrary number of normal (or lognormal) components up to some fixed number, 5) graphic 
 display of theoretical compound distribution for a specified number of components and given values 
of parameters, 6) computing algorithm for least squares solution which finds an acceptable model nearest 
to a set of initial estimates of the parameters, 7) graphic display of component probability density 
curves, 8) graphic input of threshold values for determining separability of inferred sub­ populations, 
9) statistical summary which displays final values of the parameters, results of goodness-of-fittest, 
and quantitative measures of the separability of the sub­ populations, 10) ability to restart, advance 
to next set of data or end program. By implementing the program on a terminal, a high  degree of user-directedcontrol 
is possible. A menu-selectiontype dialogue was created to allow the operator to exercise this control. 
Work space was reservedon the viewing screen to allow message printouts to assist the operator. The 
program logic follows as near as possible the logic one would use to dissect a curve manually. As a result, 
intermediate fits to the original curve can be checked, estimates of parameter values can be adjusted, 
the number of components can be changed, results for different model can be compared, and copies of 
all results can be obtained. Once data are entered and the operator has indicatedwhether to dissect 
a mixture of normal or lognormal components, a display panel shown in fig. 2 appears on the viewing 
 screen. The main work space is used to display  the observed cumulative frequency which is approximated 
by percentiles specified for the data. In the graph, the percentiles are plotted along the abscissa 
and the probabilityvalues (probits) are plotted along the ordinate. The size of the graph is kept fixed 
so that the values along each axis are scaled according to the maximum and minimum values. The axes 
are unmarked so that the operator will not be influencedby actual values. In the upper right hand corner 
of the panel, the name assignedto the data set is shown together with the designation of whether the 
data are considered to be derived from a mixed normal (N) or lognormal (LN) population. For the latter, 
the data are transformedby taking the logarithm. In the top leftmost part of the panel, space is reserved 
for messages intended to guide the operator through the dissection. In most cases, the message will either 
verify an action taken by the user in selecting an item from the menu or direct the operator to proceed. 
The menu occupies the right-hand portion of the panel and contains the identifiers of the componentsand 
parameters to choose from the types of actions to be taken. The following is a brief explanation of the 
menu: components  Fig. 2-Mixed   distribution Fig. 1-Graphic dissection a d each component is identified

 end The limited experience with the program to date has confirmed the importance of being able to switch 
back and forth between grafit and besfit,  making adjustments to the parameters and comparing results 
obtained by statistics. We turn now to consider two examples.  3. EXAMPLE IN GEOLOGY A large amount 
of data related to oil occurrence is available to those responsible for evaluating the present and future 
supply of petroleum. One of the responsibilities of geologists is to relate the occurrence of oil to 
the detailed stratigraphy and structure of the sedimentary basins where oil accumulates and is trapped 
in reservoirs. By studying the size distribution and number of oil deposits in an area, it is possibleto 
arrive at estimates as regards the size and number of undiscovered deposits. As an illustration, data 
have been collected for all oil pools in Cretaceous and Jurassic (65 to 190 million years before present) 
 reservoir rocks with more than 500,000 barrels of oil in place in Alberta, Canada /10/. The Cretaceousand 
Jurassic pools exhibit a variety of reservoir types and pose some interesting geologic problems. The 
data file contains information on the size, geometry, lithology, stratigraphy and production of over 
1100 oil and gas pools. Fig. 2 represents the cumulative frequency curve of in-place oil reserves for 
28 oil pools in the Viking formation of Late Cretaceous age. The data here are plotted on a log-probabilityscale. 
 Past experiencehas shown that the size of oil pools measured by reserves particularlywithin a single 
formationtends to follow a lognormal distribution. If that be the case, the data points in fig. 2 should 
fall more or less along a straight line. This is clearly not the case however and therefore some explanation 
is requiredto account for this deviation. A closer look at fig. 2 reveals there may be in fact two 
lognormal populations instead of one and thus we have just cause to try and dissect  the curve. Since 
the data are entered and the CRT is active, let us proceed.  The first step involves the graphic estimation 
 of the parameters for the two distributions.  It requires that we draw two lines and choose an inflectionpoint 
for the data. Fig. 3 shows the result. The slope of each line provides an estimate of the standard 
deviation, and the inflection point provides an estimate of mean and proportion for each subpopulation. 
The lines may be drawn any length anywhere on the screen and only the ordinate of the inflection point 
is needed. The theoretical curve based on the graphic estimates is shown in fig. 4. This is not bad 
for a first try.  Fig. 4-Grafit Fig. 3-Graphic   estimation By adjusting the slopes of our lines, 
we can do even better as shown in fig. 5. The curve now matches the data reasonably close. We are 
in a position to attempt a least squares best fit. This is shown in fig. 6. While the curve does not 
appear to be much different, the values of parameters have changed appreciably. In order to inspect 
the probability density functions which produced this curve, we select pdf on the menu. The result is 
shown in fig. 7. We see that the two subpopulationshave contributed Fig. 6-Besfit Fig. 5-Adjust grafit 
unequally to the total distribution. This indicates there are fewer larger oil pools in terms of reserves 
than smaller ones. To distinguish individual pools for the two populations, a threshold value can be 
selected. This is shown by the upper-case letter A in fig. 7. It allows us also to estimate the degree 
of separability of the two populations. By selecting the statistics item on the menu, we obtain quantitative 
results of dissection. This is shown in fig. 8. Because the data were  presumed to be lognormal, the 
mode, median, and mean of each component distribution are different. In this example, the values are 
expressed in millions (x 106 )of barrels of in-place reserves. Thus the smaller-sized pools which constitute 
nearly three-fourths the total number of pools have mean in-place reserves of 2.85 x 106 barrels. How 
good is the fit we have obtained? The chi­square value based on 5 class intervals (expectedclass frequency 
> 3 for each interval) is 0.15 which is low. Because there were five parameters to estimate plus one 
extra for the sum of the probabilities, there are negative degrees of freedom however for the chi-squaretest. 
Although the chi­square test cannot legitimatelybe applied, it can be noted that for 1 degree of freedomat 
the 95 confidence level, the critical value is 3.84 which is considerably greater than the value we observed. 
To apply the test on a more strict basis, we would need a larger sample of oil pools. The threshold value 
to distinguish the two populations is estimated as 11.59 x 10- barrels of oils. For this value, we would 
misclassify smaller­sized pools 1.2 percent of the time and larger sized pools 1.8 percent of the time. 
This amounts to a total 3.1 percent error. With such a small error, there is little doubt the two populations 
are distinct. In their original study, Dickie and Williams /10/ investigatedthe reasons why the two 
populations should differ. They found no single pool measurement such as porosity, permeability,water 
saturationor combination of pool measurements which uniquely classified the larger pools. The distinguishingfeature 
was that most of the larger pools occurred in the "main" Viking sand whereas the smaller pools occurred 
in restricted sandstone lenses above, below and laterally equivalent to the main  Fig. 8-Statistics 
Fig. 7-PDF sandstone. It suggests there may be genetic differences between the two types of oil accumulation. 
Clearly this requires a more detailed geologic investigation. In this instance dissection has proved 
a valuable tool for the analysis.  4. AN EXAMPLE IN SPORTS In golf as with any sport players take 
their chances. In 1975, 296 professional golfers divided up a total of slightly over $7,000,000 in prize 
money during the Professional_Golfer's Association of America (PGA) tour /11/. As might be expected, 
the money was unevenly divided among the competing golfers. As most people know, Jack Nicklaus was the 
top money winner with his share of the total being close to $300,000. What most people do not know however 
is that the golfer with the least share earned exactly $63. Moreover, the top 30 money winners won over 
half of the--total/amount and of their half, the top 15 took nearly two thirds. These statistics are 
characteristicof sporting activities in which a group of individuals are competing over a regular season 
for prize money which goes mainly to the winner and runner-up of each event and much lesser amounts 
to the rest. It is of interest to consider the nature of the distribution of prize winnings among professional 
 golfers. Through the courtesy of the Tournament Players Division of the PGA who provided the data, 
it was possible to construct a cumulative frequency curve of prize winnings for the PGA golfers who 
competed in 1975. The curve plotted on a log-probabilityscale is shown in fig. 9. If this represented 
a single lornormal distribution, the points would lie more or less along a single straight line. Clearly 
they do not however. This suggests either the data follow some other type of distribution or else the 
data represent a mixture of lognormal distributions. Suppose we choose to pursue the latter possibility. 
We can proceed by dissectingthe curve into lognormal components. The graphic estimates  Fig. 10-Graphic 
   estimation Fig. 9-Mixed   distribution for two components are shown in fig. 10. From these estimates, 
a least-squares best fit of the data is obtained and is shown in fig. 11. The probabilitydensity curves 
of the components are shown also. The theoretical curve departs somewhat from the observed cumulative 
frequency at each tail of the distribution and could be interpretedas an indication of a departure 
 from lognormality. We can examine this more carefully in the goodness-of-fit test. An upper case A 
has been positioned in fig. 11 to indicate a threshold which separates the two subpopulations. We 
consider the quantitative results of dissection given by the statistical summary shown in fig. 12. 
Based on our dissection, there are two groups of golfers divided about equally among the 296 professionals, 
one group with low winnings having a mean of around $3,500 and a second group with high winnings having 
a mean of $57,000. A chi-square test at the 95 confidence level does not reject the hypothesis that 
the data represent a mixture of two lognormal distributions. The two populations, if they are real, 
are reasonably distinct since there is less than a ten percent chance of misclassifyinga golfer into 
one of the two groups. The threshold income which divides the golfers into two groups is around $7,300. 
Obviously, more data about each golfer would be requiredbefore the analysis could proceed further. 
The distribution of prize winnings suggests perhaps that the golfers who participated in the 1975 
PGA tour did not constitute a homogeneous population.  5. CONCLUSIONS A more satisfactory solution 
to the problem of dissecting a mixed frequency distribution has been found through the application of 
inter­active computer graphics. The solution has come about mainly as the result of combining the more 
robust graphical methods with the more precise analytic techniques of regression. The graphical approach 
provides good initial estimates of the parameters to be fitted in the models whereas the analytical approach 
of regression provides final best estimates of the parameters. In an interactive environment, it is possible 
to alternate back and forth between these two methods until an acceptable solution has been obtained 
for a particular set of data. The combined approach to the dissectionof mixed frequency curves has also 
resulted in greater speed at arriving at a solution. Within a matter of minutes, for instance, it is 
possible for someone seated before a terminal to dissect a curve and examine the results. Such an increase 
in speed provides more time for an investigator to think about the results rather than on how to obtain 
them. Finally there is an element of personal satisfaction in carrying on a meaningful dialogue with 
the computer at a level in which both man and machine can understand. To have the ability to interact 
in a dynamic fashion where form and function are closely intermingled brings about a new sense of 
 discovery in data analysis. This level of communication should make for even greater progress in the 
problem of dissection in the future.  REFERENCES Karl Pearson, Contributions to the mathematical theory

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania INTERMIXING REFRESH AND DIRECT VIEW STORAGE GRAPHICS Ned Thanhouser 
 Tektronix, Inc. Beaverton,OR 97005 (503) 638-3411 This paper describes an advanced technique in hardware 
and software for the intermixed display of refresh and storage graphics. Traditional storage tube terminals 
have the advantage of low cost coupled with the ability to display large amounts of high resolution graphic 
information, but do not provide for dynamic motion and transformation of a displayed image. High resolution, 
high density refreshed displays tend to be expensive. Combining both refresh and storage graphics on 
the same display allows pictures to be segregated into static and dynamic areas to achieve the desired 
results at reduced cost. The hardware and system software to make this marriage of refresh and storage 
graphics work effectively for interactive computer graphics is described. 1. INTRODUCTION The Direct 
View Storage Tube (DVST) is known for low cost high-resolution, high density graphics. This is achieved 
by storing images directly on the face plate of the CRT [1], which eliminates the need for image regeneration. 
Now, by adding a fast constant rate vector generator and a high speed de­flaction system, an old feature 
of DVST's known as "WRITE-THRU" itis now possible to display 1600 centimeters of flicker-free refreshed 
images along with stored images. [2] Thus, it is now feasible to integrate refresh and storage into a 
single system, using refresh to display dynamic and temporary images while the static, complex por­ tions 
of a picture are displayed instorage mode. Besides integrating storage and refresh capa­bility inhardware, 
it isalso necessary to pro­vide integrated software and system support. The provision of this support 
is the novel aspect of the system described. The user can construct 're­fresh' and 'storage' pictures 
with the same com­mands and can use the Graphic Operating System facilities to maintain the structured 
display list required for refreshed images. [3] This paper describes that support and the techniques 
used in detail. Fig. 1. Hardware for Intermixing Refresh and Direct  2. HARDWARE OVERVIEW  View Storage 
Graphics. The hardware for mixing refreshed and stored images isdiagrammed infigure 1. It consists of 
3. SOFTWARE OVERVIEW a mini-computer, random access memory, a micro- The software can be broken down 
into two major areas:  coded display controller, and a 19-inch refresh/ storage display unit. On command 
from the mini-Application and System (figure 2). The Application program makes requests to the Graphic 
Operating computer, the display controller accesses the dis­ system software for graphic output. Before

 Memory Access (DMA) channel. The display list con- Graphic Transform Package (GTP). The GTP isre­ tains

controller directs the vector generation Window/ViewportMapping. Once transformed, the from which a 
picture is constructed.  graphic data ispassed to the Display Controller Driver (DCDVR), which builds 
display lists for the display controller.  Fig. 2. Software Overview The Display Controller Driver 
supports a trans­ formed display file [5,6], maintaining separate display code sequences for each individually 
iden­ tified refreshed picture. This allows distinct graphic entities or components to be manipulated 
 independent of one another.Any graphic output re­ quest which isnot identified with a refreshed ob­ject 
isdirected between refresh cycles to the storage display. The DCDVR (figure 3) consists of three major 
modules. First is the Display List Generator which isre­  sponsible for taking transformed graphic output 
requests and generating display lists, which are then displayed as stored output or passed to the second 
module, the Display List Handler. The Dis­play List Handler manages the insertion, deletion, and modification 
of the refreshed display list. The third module is the Display Controller Inter­rupt Service Routine, 
which is responsible for starting up a display list and switching between storage and refresh output. 
Together, these modules manage the output of storage graphics while main­taining refresh display lists. 
  4. GRAPHIC OUTPUT Graphic Output requests to the Graphic Operating system are made with a parameter 
block as outlined below:  14 The OP-CODE specifies the type of graphics (i.e., MOVE, DRAW, DASH, 
or POINT and ABSOLUTE or RELA- TIVE), while X and Y fields specify an X-Y coord­inate pair to which the 
beam is to be positioned. For example, to draw a box in storage with sides of 100 units at (0,0)the 
following sequence of vector requests would be made:  Fig. 3. Display Controller Driver The display 
controller driver takes these requests and builds display code infixed length blocks of memory. The interrupt 
service routine outputs the storage graphics between refresh cycles. When dis­played, these blocks of 
memory are re-used for sub­sequent storage output requests.  5. REFRESH OBJECT CONSTRUCTION A sequence 
of vector output requests, like the one given above, normally generates a stored image. The display 
code generated for the picture istraversed once and discarded. However, the user may condi­tionally save 
the display code generated by such a sequence as a refreshed object. This is done by preceding vector 
output requests with an OPEN com­mand. This builds the display code generated by graphic output requests 
into dynamic memory areas. A CLOSE command stops the display code capturing process, and any further 
graphic output reverts to the storage display. The just-built 'refresh' ob­ject is not visible on the 
screen but isavailable for individual manipulation as described under Re­ fresh Object Manipulate. The 
process of object construction may be summarized by the following state diagram:  An existing object 
may have vectors added to it by an APPEND command. A KILL command deletes the ob­ject from the system 
and returns the memory used to hold the display to the dynamic memory pool.  6. REFRESH OBJECT MANIPULATION 
 Once an object isbuilt, several manipulation com­mands can be used to affect its viewing status. A POST 
command links the display list for an object to the refresh display list and thus makes it visi­ ble 
on the screen. An UNPOST removes the object from the display list, making it invisible. A BLINK command 
causes the object to be automatically POSTed and UNPOSTed at a regular interval. FIX re­moves the object 
from the refresh list and then displays it in the storage mode. Figure 4 shows a house partially built 
by an OPEN sequence, then finished by an APPEND. The house is then make vis­ ible with a POST, invisible 
with an UNPOST, drawn in storage with a FIX, and the display list isdis­ carded with a KILL. The final 
object manipulation command, SETPOINT, allows dynamic modification of the initial X and Y coordinates 
of an object under program control. The first two coordinates of an object are us­ ually an absolute 
move, referred to as a setpoint, followed by relative moves and draws. Thus, ifthe first absolute move's 
X and Y coordinates are changed, then the rest of the picture will be re­ located dynamically. Consider 
the following example which defines a box as object number 1: OPEN OBJECT NO. 1 MOVE ABSOLUTE 0,0 
DRAW RELATIVE 100, 0 DRAW RELATIVE 0,100 DRAW RELATIVE -100,0 DRAW RELATIVE 0,-100 POST OBJECT NO. 
1 This will draw a box with sides of 100 units in re­fresh at (0,0)on the display. To move the box (ob­ject 
number 1) to location (500,1000), the follow­ing SETPOINT command isgiven: SETPOINT OBJECT NO. 1,500,1000 
The box will immediately appear at the new location.  Fig. 4. Refreshed Object Manipulation Note also 
what happens if the second vector of an object isa draw absolute, e.g.,  Now, any SETPOINT commands 
to object number 4 causes the refreshed vector from the first move absolute to the draw absolute to follow 
like a rubber band, with one end anchored at 100,100. Many variations of this can be used for dragging 
and rubber band applications.  7. THE DISPLAY CONTROLLER  An Exchange Display.Status Command initiates 
the sequence which allows the Display Controller to ac­cess the display lists residing inmemory. When 
an Exchange Status Command is given, the dis­play controller swaps all its current status re­gisters 
with the contents of the status block in memory. The display code pointed to by the just­loaded block 
is started. This exchange of status isalso used to interrupt a display list to let a new section of display 
code execute. The first list resumes execution where itwas interruptedat the receipt of another Exchange 
Status Command. Essen­tially, the Exchange Status may be viewed as a form of co-routine call An elementary 
use of the Exchange Status command would display two different pictures, A and B, each with its own status. 
One set of display contextual registers would be in the display controller for the current picture, 
and the other would be inan Ex­change Status block. When display of picture A is finished, the current 
status block is swapped and picture B is started. When picture B is done, an­other exchange ismade and 
picture A isnow swapped in. Note that only one Exchange Status block is needed, since the status of the 
current picture being displayed is kept inthe display controller registers.   This method is useful 
ifpictures are always swapped on a rotating basis. It has the disadvantage that a different block each 
time it resumes the same picture. Ingeneral, for n pictures, n-l status blocks would be needed using 
this scheme. For a more general use of the Exchange Status com­mand, a "Dummy" display list isused to 
allow ran­dom selection of any segment of display code and to keep each segment associated with one 
status block. Thus, three pictures could be implemented as follows:  3. Two Exchange Status Commands 
must be given to start a different display list. The first references the current picture status block, 
and the second references the new block. This provides simple, fast selection of log­ically different 
pictures.  4. Addition and deletion of pictures iseasy inthe general case.  5. This method performs 
the same function as  separate 'save status' and 'restore status' commands, but uses only one command. 
  8. DISPLAY CONTROLLER DRIVER IMPLEMENTATION The Display controller Driver consists of the three major 
modules mentioned before: the Display Code Generator (DCG), the Display List Handler (DLH), and the Display 
Controller Interrupt Service Routine (DCISR). The DCG passes information to the DCISR via the Display 
Output Queue (DCOQ) (Figure 5). A storage vector output request to the DCG causes display code to be 
built infixed length blocks of memory. These blocks are linked together by a dis­play branch command. 
Once the storage graphics have been displayed, the fixed length blocks are re-used for subsequent storage 
output requests. Character output causes ASCII to be passed to the DCISR where it is converted to display 
code and traversed. Commands such as erase or make copy are also passed on the DCOQ (figure 6).  The 
dummy list contains only a "STOP" and an "INTER- RUPT" command. Thus, this use of Exchange Display Status 
has the following characteristics: 1. Any picture may be interrupted and restarted at any time.  2. 
Each picture has a fixed status block as­sociated with it.   Fig. 5. Display Controller Output Queue 
Format. Programs and asynchronous interrupting devices, such as the keyboard, and communicationswhich 
re­quire single character echoing make entries on the Echo Queue (ECHOQ) by calling the routine ANECHO. 
Inorder to prevent input queues from overflowing, this queue is given higher priority than the DCOQ. 
 Vector output requests to the display code gene­ rator which have been preceded by an OPEN or APPEND, 
cause the display code to be built into fixed length areas of dynamic memory. The Display List Handler 
(DLH) links these blocks of display code to the refresh list when POSTed, unlinks them when UNPOSTed, 
etc. A CLOSE or POST command causes all further vector output to be directed to the storage display,until 
an OPEN or APPEND starts the process again. Figure 7 shows the data structure used for man­aging the 
refreshed objects. Each refreshed ob­ject has an entry inthe Refreshed Objects Table. Flags are kept 
in this table for each refreshed object to indicate its status, e.g., Existing or Non-existing object 
 Object under construction, i.e., after OPEN but not CLOSEd Posted or not posted Blinking or not blinking 
 Blink rate and current blink count Pointer to first and last block of display code  Posting an object 
isthus: finding the last block of the preceding object, modifying its branch ad­ dress to the first 
block of the object to be posted; and setting the branch address in the last block of the object to 
be posted to the first block of the next posted object. Unposting is a simple re­ versal of the above. 
Blinking isaccomplished by automatic posting and unposting of an object by the DCISR. Performing an 
exchange status for each object would burden the minicomputerwith an excessive amount of interrupts 
ifmany objects were being displayed. Only one Exchange Status block isused for the re­ fresh list (there 
are four other Exchange Status blocks: STORAGE OUTPUT, CHARACTER OUTPUT, ECHO OUTPUT, and DUMMY LIST). 
The first portion of each refreshed object's display code contains a mini­ status block. This includes 
a series of Load Fig. 6. Display Controller Status Register Commands to set the correct status for 
the object. Only one Exchange Status Command to start the display list for all re­freshed objects is 
required. The mini-status block insures that the correct status is set inthe dis­play controller for 
that object. The last object links to an immediate command, stop display list and generate interrupt. 
This interrupt signals the DCISR that the refreshed display list has been traversed.The DCISR, in this 
condition, checks for characters to be echoed on ECHOQ, and then for storage output, text or commands 
on DCOQ. Each of the display requests, e.g., storage output, is started by an Exchange Status Command 
and ended by a Stop display with Interrupt Command inthe dis­play code. Ifthere are no outstanding requests, 
the "Dummy" list is swapped in.  Fig. 7. Refreshed Objects Data Structure A special refresh timer indicates 
when the refreshed image should be regenerated to maintain the image on the screen. When it is time 
for a new refresh cycle, the processor is interruptedand control is given to a special routine in the 
DCISR. If the refresh list isstill running at the time the re­ fresh timer interrupts (i.e., the refresh 
list takes longer to display than one refresh timer cycle), the interrupt is ignored and flicker isal­ 
lowed to occur. Ifno list isrunning, the DCISR is activated and the refresh list restarted. Note that 
all storage output, including character generation, is done between refresh cycles. Our initial design 
called for interruption of executing display of a storage list (via an Exchange Status Command) if the 
refresh timer interrupted. Ifthe refresh list being displayed took longer to dis­play than one refresh 
cycle, then, at most, a single storage vector would be outputted per re­fresh cycle. Thus, with a large 
refresh picture being displayed, only 40 storage vectors per second would be displayed. This technique 
was abandoned in favor of outputting a large number of storage vectors, uninterrupted, between refresh 
cycles. Using this technique, intermixing large amounts of refresh and storage does not affect the speed 
of storage graphic output, nor does it noticeably in­crease the flicker of the refresh image already 
exceeding the display cycle time. 9. CONCLUSION This paper has described the software and hardware 
used to allow the intermixing of storage graphic output while maintaining a refreshed image. The Exchange 
Display Status Command provides a great amount of flexibility not discussed here. For ex­ample, refresh 
pictures could be prioritized, and those of a higher priority prevented from flicke­ ring by interrupting 
other lower priority re­freshed display lists. Exchange Status might also be used as an alternative method 
of character echoing. Instead of queuing a character to be dis­played at the end of the next refresh 
cycle, the echoing routine could simply Exchange Status, in­terrupt the current display list, and start 
the display list to generate the character echo. When done, another exchange status would resume the 
original display list. Nonetheless, the imple­mentation described demonstrates that it is pos­sible to 
intermix Refresh and Direct View Graphics ina consistent and effective manner that is still  flexible 
and easy for an application programmer to use. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Credit must be given to Dean Bailey 
and Roger Handy for their foresight inthe design of the Display Controller hardware and to Larry Koenigsberg

Arts D. Verne Morland Computed Image Systems and Services General Electric Company Syracuse, New York 
USA 13201 The discovery of stereopsis in the mid-nineteenth century presented the opportunity to simulate 
the visual impact of a three-dimensional entity through a pair of two-dimensional, perspective images. 
Modern image processing techniques now permit the extensive exploration of abstract stereograms, but 
most recent investigations have focused on scientific rather than aesthetic compositions. This paper 
describes a complete svstem for the creation of stereo artwork and discusses the implications of using 
stereoscopy for artistic, three-dimensional expression. 1. INTRODUCTION 2. THE GENIGRAPHICS GRAPHIC DESIGN 
SYSTEM Ever since the introduction of stereoscopy in 1838 A rudimentary explanation of the two-dimensional 
artists and scientists alike have been intrigued by its graphic capabilities of the GENIGRAPHICS system 
extraordinary ability to portray three-dimensional must necessarily precede any detailed discussion of 
a relationships. Except in the case of stereophotography, stereoscopic extension. however, the creation 
of the requisite left and right two-dimensional perspective images has presented a 2.1 Hardware formidable 
problem. For many years the binocular parallax, which is the basis of stereopsis, was approx-The basic 
system is composed of three elements: the imated by separating corresponding points in the left Artist 
s Console, the Graphics Processor, and the and right images by a distance directly proportional to High 
Resolution Recorder. See fig. 1. their depth. In 1966 Chisnell and Winter [ 1]demonstrated the short-comings 
of this approach and proposed a computer-based system for synthesizing the true left and right perspective 
projections of three-dimensional data. Since that time a number of computer driven displays have employed 
stereoscopic principles to pre­sent three-dimensional information; however, the aim of most of these 
systems has been to communicate technical design structures (automobiles, piping net­works) rather than 
aesthetic constructs. Recently, the fundamental elements of stereoscopy have been integrated with the 
full color, high resolution, interactive graphics system developed and marketed by General Electric as 
its GENIGRAPHICS* 100 artwork system. This combination has produced a hybrid two­and three-dimensional 
abstract graphics design tool which affords heretofore unattainable flexibility in the creation of a 
wide range of art. This paper discusses the genre of graphic images which can be created on this new 
stereographic system and it considers many of the system design criteria that have an impact on the artistic 
construction of three-dimensional environments. Fig. 1 -Basic GEMGRAPHICS System Configuration *"GENIGRAPHICS"

monitor, solid-state raster display hardware, and a wide variety of input devices -an alphanumeric key­board, 
two joysticks, five rate knobs, and an array of lighted and unlighted pushbuttons and switches ­arranged 
to facilitate the intuitive manipulation of graphic design elements. The Graphics Processor is a 16-bit

the creation and manipulation of five basic graphic entities: 1. Text strings 2. Rectangles (squares) 
 3. Ellipses (circles and sectors) 4. Lines (contiguous straight segments) 5. Areas (straight segment 
or B-spline perimeters)  Although the ability to define and control these five classes of graphic elements 
would be completely satis­factory for most computer-aided design systems in­tended for the refinement 
of technical subjects, the interactive capabilities provided by the GENIGRAPHICS system encourage the 
creation of aesthetic compositions. Typically, objects are not described numerically according to some 
X-Y reference grid, but rather the basic components of the artwork are interactively defined, positioned, 
sized, and colored by using the joysticks, rate knobs, and function buttons. The GENIGRAPHICS artist 
composes his work in real-time with the assistance of rectangular object reference symbols. The actual 
image is updated only when the artist issues a regeneration command. The artist can use up to 61 different 
colors in one image and he can choose those colors either from a standard system­defined palette or by 
specifying hue (0-217), chroma (0-160) and value (0-217) descriptors. The artist can also zoom in on 
any portion of the image plane for a magnification ranging from 1X to 150X. Furthermore, at the touch 
of a button the artist can automatically establish a wide variety of design relationships including: 
1. Horizontal and vertical alignment 2. Object size standardization 3. Type size standardization 4. 
Equal spacing 5. Graduated sizing 6. Visual priority 7. Color equivalence 8. Horizontal mirroring 
° rotation about a vertical axis) 9. Duplication  When a piece of artwork has been completed it may 
be recorded immediately on color positive film or it may be stored in digital form on magnetic tape. 
Once stored on tape, individual graphic symbols or entire images can easily be recalled and merged into 
one composite picture. 3. THE STEREOSCOPIC EXTENSION Since the description of interesting three-dimensional 
objects and environments is usually both a conceptually difficult and a technically tedious task, the 
stere­oscopic extension of the GENIGRAPHICS system was designed to conform to the following operational 
criteria: 1. The system should be flexible enough to encourage the creation of a wide variety of provocative 
three-dimensional construc­tions and yet straightforward enough to be operated by an artist, not an engineer. 
 2. Complex objects that exist in or span several depth levels should be constructed out of elementary 
objects that are individ­ually defined at only one depth level. 3. The artist should be able to establish 
cer­tain standard depth level relationships within specified groups of objects auto­matically (cf. the 
equal X-Y spacing function in the design relationships above). 4. Visual confirmation (feedback) of 
depth relationships should be immediately available to the artist during the artwork creation process. 
 The first point is the most important for it represents a reaffirmation of the principal axiom of user-oriented 
system design. Consequently, although the mathemat­ical expressions which describe the fundamental geom­etry 
of stereoscopy involve a plethora of independent variables -point-of-view coordinates, interocular dis­tance, 
orientation of the image plane, et cetera -the implementation of those equations in the present system 
reduces the general case to the specific viewing struc­ ture illustrated in fig. 3. Under this system 
the left and right points-of-view are fixed ((-5x, 0y, 100z) and (+5x, 0y, 100z), respectively), the 
interocular distance vector is, therefore, (10x, 0y, 0z), and the optic axes,when parallel to each other, 
are perpendicular to the image plane. The structure of the GENIGRAPHICS "stereospace" can best be understood 
by studying its orthostereoscopic re­ presentation (fig. 3). The artist should imagine that he is sitting 
in front of a large box (1. 5m X 1. 5m X 1. 1m)with his eyes fixed a short distance (10. 2cm) away from 
the center of the front side. His view into the box is re­ stricted by two viewports which allow both 
eyes to see through a 46cm X 61cm rectangle on the transparentimage plane which is located exactly halfway 
back in the box. Naturally, with these restrictions he is capable of seeingonly those objects which intersect 
his "cones" of vision. Note that the design of the stereospace prevents the artist from placing any object 
too close to the viewpoints which would cause convergence-accommodation con­fusion for the observer and 
might also tend to obscure a significant portion of the active image area. scopic image elements. These 
are objects or groupsof objects for which the principal monocular depth cue (interposition) and the binocular 
depth cue (binocularparallax) are in conflict. Pseudoscopic objects areessential to the creation of transparent 
and translucent effects. Often the artist may wish to portray a solid object bycreating a large number 
of identical shapes and evenlyspacing them very closely together in depth. If this isdone properly, the 
observer will mentally integrate allof the shapes into one cohesive percept. To facilitate the creation 
of this very powerful illusion as well as other structurally similar constructions (stairs, tex­tures, 
fence posts), the system provides an automatic linear depth spacing function which requires only the 
start and stop depth levels and is independent of any X-Y orientation. Finally, to enable the artist 
to study and to modify the depth relationships within an image interactively, the GENIGRAPHICS stereo 
system will present both theleft and right perspective views on the console monitor simultaneously. When 
the artist then views the screen through a special prismatic viewing hood (fig. 4) he will perceive the 
image in relief**. Should he wish tochange the depth coordinate of any object he can easilyreturn to 
the original, two-dimensional image and modify the depth specification that was in error. We satisfy 
the second criterion by partitioning the depth axis between the front and the back limits with a series 
of over 47 000 evenly-spaced "depth planes."The artist now considers individual graphic elements to be 
infinitely thin, opaque shapes that may be sus­pended in any depth plane. In practice, the artist first 
constructs the orthographic projection of the three­ dimensional environment in the image plane. He then 
assigns a depth coordinate to each object which implic­itly projects it perpendicularly into the appropriatedepth 
plane. Although this convention forces the artist to explicitly correlate the two-dimensional visual 
pri­ority and the three-dimensional depth assignment (atrivial task for the computer), it was so designed 
in­tentionally in order to permit the creation of pseudo-At this point it may be argued that the existence 
of single objects which are not parallel to the image planeis essential even to many of the most primitive 
three­dimensional compositions. If this be the case, which is debatable, it should be noted that it is 
possible to produce a certain subset of this class of objects, namely, those objects whose depth gradient 
is piece­wise linear at the boundary. Consider for example, the case of a cube being viewed at an angle 
from which only the top, the front, and theright side can be seen. If the front is parallel to the image 
plane, then the two visible sides must necessarily be perpendicular to it. These two surfaces can be 
precisely created by the following procedure: 1. A stereo image of the front and back of the cube is 
created (fig. 5). This may be accom­plished by creating two identical squares at the same X-Y location 
and then projecting the front square forward. 2. The top of the cube is then constructed in each view 
by connecting the upper edges of the front and rear sides (fig. 6). 3. The right side of the cube is 
similarly con­structed by connecting the right edges of the front and rear sides (fig. 7).  The linear, 
continuous change in parallax that exists along the left and right edges of the top surface and along 
the top and bottom edges of the right surface is visually consistent with a constant depth gradient. 
This same concept can be applied to more complex polygons simply by defining the depth value for each 
vertex. Furthermore, since the interior of each polygon is uniformly colored, it is impossible to vis­ 
ually correlate any two random points in corresponding objects in the left and right images. As a result 
it is Impossible to create a convex or concave contour with­ in a single object. This consequence may 
be regarded favorably, however, since the absence of any binocular parallax in the interior of any object 
also precludes the possibility of any parallax-related depth conflicts be­ tween the interior and the 
perimeter. In general, therefore, the depth contour of the interior will be un­ consciously interpreted 
by the brain as that topology that is most consistent (i.e., natural or familiar) with the rest of its 
graphic environment. The cerebral aspects of depth interpretation are fur­ ther emphasized by noting 
the cooperation* between monocular and binocular depth cues. The depth rela­ tionships between separate 
elements of a complex graphic symbol that are suggested by monocular tech­ niques -shading, linear perspective, 
actual size vs known size relationships, et cetera -are significantly enhanced when the entire symbol 
is projected into a single depth plane by binocular parallax. This appears to be so, despite the conflict 
between the singular parallax and the multiple depth levels intimated by the monocular clues. Naturally, 
this sensation is achieved more easily as the perceived distance between the object and the observer 
increases since the mind is more inclined to ignore more minor, isolated discrep­ ancies in favor of 
a consistent global structure. This phenomenon is also strongly influenced by the degree of the observer's 
familiarity with the percept involved. 3.2 Features of Abstract Stereoscopic Images When contemplating 
how and by whom stereoscopic images might be used it is essential to begin with a review of viewing devices 
and techniques. Suffice it to say that no one has yet been able to detect anynatural dissimilarity between 
the left and the rightvisual system which might permit encoding of the left image for acceptance by only 
the left eye and of the right image for acceptance by only the right eye. Con­sequently, every viewing 
scheme must artificially impair the vision of each eye in such a way that the necessary image-eye correlation 
is achieved. Of the many techniques suggested for this purpose, the most popular have been: 1. The mirror 
stereoscope (Wheatstone) 2. The prismatic stereoscope 3. The on-axis stereoscope (no angular correction 
needed) 4. The parallax barrier techniques [ 3] including:  a) Parallel barriers (e.g., Ives "parallax 
stereogram" and Kanolt's "parallax panoramagram") *The use of "cooperation" here is not intended to imply 
a cooperative system exhibiting disorder-order transistions, hysteresis, and multiple-stable states [ 
2] but rather it is used to describe the simple enhance­ment or reinforcement of a psychological interpreta­tion 
by several congruous but independent sensory inputs. b) Optical (lens) barriers (Lippman) c) Radial barriers 
(Ivanol) 5. The polarized light technique including the transmission-reflection method (Ortony[ 4] ) 
 6. The color filter method (anaglyphs)  Each of these techniques has its own unique advantages and 
disadvantages but since they all involve either selec­tive vision impairment or viewing position constraints, 
prolonged stereo viewing can often become uncomfort­able. The stereoscopes (1-3) typically produce the 
highest quality images but they are usually limited to one viewing position. The parallax barrier, polarizedlight, 
and color filter techniques (4-6), all tend to de­grade the image quality to some extent but they gener­ally 
allow the stereo image to be viewed by several people simultaneously. Given an effective viewing strategy, 
stereograms are usually more interesting than conventional two­dimensional graphics. Some critics might 
argue that this is primarily due to their novelty alone, yet this explanation is unsatisfactory. In spite 
of the fact that we receive depth information from a wide variety of monocular or single-image cues, 
nevertheless, we will never confound a flat picture with its subject. In con­ trast to this, Wheatstone 
noted in 1838 that "careful attention would enable an artist to draw and paint the two component pictures 
[of a stereogram] , so as to present to the mind of the observer, in the resultant perception, perfect 
identity with the object repre­sented. "[5] This hypothesis has been substantiated by modern stereophotographs 
which engender visual sen­sations that are virtually indistinguishable from those produced directly by 
the subject environments. When portraying abstract three-dimensional scenes, binocular parallax becomes 
even more important due to the absence of many monocular cues. Within the artificial world of the GENIGRAPHICS 
stereospace the observer cannot rely on many of the usual depth cues which typically facilitate depth 
localization in real space. Despite the absence of these visual prompts, the depth relationships in a 
GENIGRAPHICS stereoslide are so startling that the composition seems almost tangible. The obvious conclusion 
to be drawn from this experience is that a well-designed stereo presentation is capable of maintaining 
a higher level of audience interest than a two-dimensional presentation even though the semantic information 
may be the same (cf.black-and-white vs color presentations). The second important advantage which stereoscopy 
holds over single-image information display is that the depth sensation that is communicated by binocular 
parallax appears to be more basic and straightforward than that implied by monocular cues. As Julesz, 
observes: "Most of the monocular depth cues require a tremendous memory capacity; for instance, familiarity 
with perceived objects implies a [mental] catalog of no mean extent. "Binocular depth cues seem simpler 
and more akin to data processing. "[ 6] Since stereopsis is a more elementary perceptual pro­cess, this 
means that it is applicable to the problem of conveying three-dimensional constructions to individuals 
who may lack familiarity with many of the complex rules for perspective projection. For example, a six 
year old child may be unprepared to interpret the three­dimensional significance of fig. 8 and yet clearly 
under­ stand the stereoscopic cube that resulted from the con­struction process outlined in fig. 5, 6, 
7. Stereos­copy, therefore, is an ideal technique for convenientlycommunicating a very strong sense of 
three-dimensional relationships without relying on any graphics experience. Furthermore, even those 
individuals who are skilled in interpreting planar views of three-dimensional objects find that stereoscopy 
tends to improve their ability to envision complex structures by a "qualitative order of magnitude. " 
To illustrate this point, consider the fact that many experienced chemists who have dealt with planar 
projections of molecular structures for most of their lives now rely heavily on stereoscopic represen­tations 
of the more complex organic compounds in order to gain a detailed understanding of their struc­ture. 
Thus, the dimensional clarity of stereogramshas great appeal to novice and expert alike. 4. CONCLUSION 
Stereoscopy is not a new idea. Over the years, thou­sands of artists, scientists, and engineers have 
sought to simplify both the stereogram creation and the view­ing problems to the end that this remarkable 
capacity for three-dimensional communication might become a practical reality. The stereographic system 
presented here succeeds in simplifying the creation of stereograms which portrayabstract aesthetic compositions. 
This is not an analy­sis tool for the research scientist or engineer; rather it is an instrument through 
which the artist can experi­ ment with an exciting new medium for sculptural ex­pression. With this new 
freedom some new responsi­bilities and disciplines are imposed. Just as the creation of any preconceived 
composition has alwaysdemanded a systematic approach to both the subject and the medium; so, too, the 
creation of a truly imaginative environment within the GENIGRAPHICS stereospace requires careful planning 
and the talented manipulation of this sophisticated tool. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was inspired by the 
exciting research on stereopsis and optical pattern recognition conducted by Dr. Bela Julesz of Bell 
Laboratories. Through the invention and application of his random-dot stereo­grams, Dr. Julesz has significantly 
advanced our understanding of the fascinating realm of Cyclopean perception. Special thanks go also to 
my colleagues at the General Electric Company for the design, manu­facture, and maintenance of the GENIGRAPHICS 
100 computerized art system on which this stereographic system was founded. Fig. 8 - Cube - One-Point

 A USER-ORIENTED COMPUTER GRAPHICS SYSTEM Udo W. Pooch Computing Science Division Texas A&#38;M University 
College Station, Texas 77843 A user-oriented Computer Graphics System (CGS) is described, which primarily 
has been designed to aid the application programmer, and not just the sophisticated computer graphics 
user. The system has been designed to provide a very simple interaction capability, where the interaction 
 isbased on a variety of input devices and a simple input/output graphics command language. The result 
of this system has been an increase in programming efficiency, reduction in span time from creations 
of design to actual implementation. Typical application developments have included such system as flowcharting 
systems, Computer Aided Architectural Space Planning, Animation, Vehicle-PedestrianInteractions, Computer-aideddesigns, 
and the simulation of the NASA Space Shuttle. 1.0 INTRODUCTION The basic minicomputer configuration

able to manipulate a data base displayed on the interactive graphics terminal until the user has obtained 
satisfactory results, and only then produce the final high resolution drawing. The goal of the CGS was 
to provide a capability which would interactively (a) permit conversational man -computer graphical 
communication on a mini­computer, and  (b) provide a maximum programming flexi­bility and ease of use 
for experimenta­tion.   Both of these goals are achieved through the use of a Graphical Interactive 
System (GIS) which interfaces to the basic CGS System, providing the ability to: 1. display three-dimensional 
drawings, three-dimensional windowing and per­spective generation  2. handle deletions or additions 
of lines or other basic geometric configurations  3. handle enlargement of certain areas, modificationof 
their geometry, and reduction of this modification back into the original design  4. display the view 
of the represented geometry from any angle  5. display the work on two sections separatelyand adjust 
their fitting properties  6. display simultaneouslyor separately four different views -top, front, side 
to side and angled perspective. Any change inone view will automatically show up in the other views 
 7. handle rotation of the design ina com­plete stereoscopic circle  8. display the overlap of two pictures 
or designs to permit comparisons of the differences and similarities in their information.   Furthermore, 
the GIS system permits at any stage of the graphical display the preservation of the display inhard copy 
drawings (from the Gerber S-622) for engineering use, as well as provides for a convenient means of communicating: 
 I. alphanumeric information II. multiple choice decision responses to the computer.  The parametric 
functional keys supported by the GIS system consists of the following: 1. rotate (either side to side, 
or top to bottom)  2. scale (enlarge and/or reduce)  3. create certain basic geometry  4. move  5. 
delete  6. duplicate  7. generate projections and steroscopic views  8. transform and/or translate 
 9. retrieve, combine, dissect and file images  10. replay last image (i.e., memory buffer of one image) 
 11. project orthographically   3.0 COMPONENTS OF THE CGS LIBRARY 3.1 Level I: Basic CGS Control 
Routines These routines provide all the necessary "basic" functions for use of the Gerber 622 and the 
 Computek System and include the following major sections. (a) The Gerber Basic software system isa 
set of FORTRAN subroutines designed for use with any Gerber Digital plotting system to produce charts, 
graphs, maps, drawings, special curves, alphanumeric characters or symbols, or any other form of pictorial 
output. Both single line and paragraph writing of a text are included inthis set of subroutines as are 
alteration routines for parameters, general purpose driving routines (or drafting routines), output routines, 
and a special routine to produce a BCD character string for plotting.  (b) The Calcomp Plotter Simulator 
software package provides absolute compatibility of the Gerber Basic software with the basic driving 
routines offered through Calcomp -i.e., options to specify output for 1)Calcomp plotters, 2) Gerber plotters, 
and 3) both types of plotters, ifdesired. In this package isa set of plotter subroutines designed to 
prepare magnetic tapes for off-line plotting. The Calcomp basic software provides all the functions required 
for controlling and driving the digital plotting system such as scaling the data to fit the plotting 
area, drawing identification symbols at plotted data points, drawing lines connecting data points when 
desired, drawing and label­ing axes at any desired orientation, and selecting from a large number of 
  characters, numbers, and special symbols, any of which can be drawn inany size and at any angular 
orientation anywhere on the plotting surface. (c) The Special Function routines are basically concerned 
with the graphing of data. These routines are divided into four major packages. The Func­tional General 
package consists of eight FORTRAN subroutines that greatly simplify the job of drawing lines in several 
 standard shapes and figures. Itallows the user to draw curves, circles, arcs, polygons, dashed lines, 
and grids with a single call to the appropriate sub­routine. The Functional Scientific package also 
consists of eight FORTRAN subroutines but isdesigned to simplify both the data reduction and the graphic 
 display of raw data. These subroutines can be a powerful tool for the presenta­ tion of data in research, 
design analysis, testing, quality control tech­ nical documentation,etc.; and they are for plotting 
logarithmic data, poly­nomials, polar coordinates, and for smoothing and refining graphs that have to 
be plotted with a minimum of data points. The third major package isthe Functional Drafting package which 
con­sists of five FORTRAN subroutines that provide most of the symbols and an­notations that appear repeatedly 
in drafting jobs. The last major package isthe Functional Business package which consists of ten FORTRAN 
subroutines that provide the capability to display most business applications. Such functions as business, 
logarithmic and calendar oriented axes, shading and bar plotting are provided.  3.2 Level 2: Data Plotting 
Routines This package provides a convenientmeans of gen­erating graphic displays of data collections 
in diverse forms. Functions expressed as collections of data points or infunctional form may be plotted 
(i.e., cumulative distribution data, raw­point data, and general functions). Multiple plots and/or graphs 
may be generated with auto­matic scaling and labeling. Multiple plotting symbols may be selected and 
facilitiesare pro­vided for constructing smooth curves through the data (up to ten orders of least square 
curve fits). Also this Data Plotting package provides an auto­matic trace and labeling of printed output 
gen­erated, as well as providing for the plotting of histograms, scatter diagrams, and pie graphs. 3.3 
Level 3: Three-Dimensional Data and Surface Plotting Routines The Three-Dimensional Data software system 
in­cludes a set of FORTRAN subroutines designed to produce perspective drawings of any physical or hypothetical 
surface that can be represented as a single-valued function of two variables. This includes line generation 
and annotation, size specification and scaling, projections of three-dimensional lines, curves, axes, 
grids, surfaces, and the plotting of curves in rec­tangular as well as polar coordinates. The user can 
specify that the surface be drawn opaque ("hidden" lines automatically deleted), or transparent. He 
can change the viewing distance, and the viewing angle, to provide a closer look at different portions 
of the surface, or even "walk around" it insuccessive drawings. By varying the positionof the viewing 
points and deleting hidden lines, the user can also study the effects of variables on different portions 
of the surface. Actually "seeing" these effects gives a far better intuitive feel for the problems at 
hand than does reading a collection of numbers. Inaddition, the THREE-D subroutine enables the user 
to produce gridless drawings of digitized X,Y,Z data. For the maximum in real­istic presentation, the 
THREE-D system can be used to generate stereoscopic views of a surface. The two drawings in a stereo 
pair are plotted from two different viewpoints, separated by an angle equal to the normal angular difference 
 between an observer's eyes. Another set of FORTRAN subroutines associated with the 3-D software system 
isgrouped under the isographic software system. This set of sub­routines allows the user to draw, inthe 
plane of the plotting paper, the projections of points, lines, and curves defined ina UVW coordinate 
system oriented in any desired manner with respect to the paper. Included are a basic routine for moving 
the pen from the projection of one point to the projection of another, a routine for drawing labeled 
and annotated projected axes, and Equation evaluation, which pro­a routine for drawing projected grids. 
duces representative values for Six FORTRAN subroutines collectively known as IGRAPH that are also associated 
with the 3-D system are called by the user's main program and inturn call upon the library routines prepared 
for the Gerber plotter. These programs will plot, in isometric projection, a surface defined by two independent 
variables. 3.4 Level 4: Contour Plotting Routines This package of routines allows contour plotting 
by two different methods: (i)Numerical approximation over a uniform grid; (ii)Least squares surface 
fitting to provide for trend surface analysis type drawings.  This package isable to: (1)Accept random 
data pointsinput using any size or type of rectangular co­ordinate system; (2)Accept specification for 
scaling of output drawing; (3)Accept an option for plotting the input data points on the map charts 
at the user's discretion; (4)Accept annotation of the contour lines drawn with their respective values; 
 (5)Grid lines showing the location of user specified coordinate values that can be drawn on the charts 
whenever desired; (6)Itcan draw a border around the map plot area, at the user's option; (7)Provision 
ismade to make approximate notes inthe margins of the map; (8)The user has the option of being able 
to get a printed listing of all the computed grid mesh data points. General Purpose Contouring System 
(GPCS) 1. Data Handling Programs a. Control Card Analyzer and Editor b. XYZ File Creation  c. Printer

Polynomials, which fit orthogonal polynomials to either regularly or irregularly distributed data a 
surface by evaluating a defining equation at the mesh points of a square grid or at data points defined 
by input X-Y coordinates 3. Operations on and between surfaces a. Smoothing b.Grid Interpolation 
c. Grid-to-Grid or Point-to-Point Operations  d. Numerical Intergration Grid Interpolationwhich takes 
the values that define a surface at the mesh points of a square grid and, by nonlinear interpolation, 
defines the surface on a grid with a different spacing and/or origin. Smoothing, which applies a controllable 
degree of smoothing to the values that define a sur­face, thereby eliminating unwanted minor irregularities 
inthe surface  Grid-to-Grid or Point-to-Point Operations, which adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides 
the values at the common points on up to three grid networks or at up to three input data points 
Numerical Integration,which takes the surface defined at the mesh points of a square grid and com­ putes 
surface areas, projected areas, or volumes by techniques of numerical integration 4. Graphics Display 
 a. Contouring  b. Map Annotation Contouring, which takes a surface defined by values on a square grid 
and produces a graphical display representing a contour map  Map Annotation, which produces a map of 
x-y coordinates represented by significant symbols (These symbols may be annotated.)  Additional programs 
may be written by the user and incorporated into the GPCS System in the following ways: Use of user 
exits which are provided with two of the functions that the user may modify files use of user exits 
which are provided with the graphic display programs. (This allows adaptation of GPCS to different 
display devices.)  The basic functions of the GPCS are broken down into six levels of operation: 1. 
Basic Operations The capability to read and interpolate random data points and/or gridded data inserted 
into the system in varied formats from cards, tape or disk. This allows the use of the data to be prepared 
for any other application program without the  need to reformat the data. Surface fitting, interpolation 
and actual con­touring plotting with a variety of annotations capability is provided for both the contoured 
and raw data. 2. Multiple Surface Operations The capability of interpolating one or more surfaces simulataneously, 
in almost any algebraic surface manipulation. Surfaces can be added, multiplied, sub­tracted or divided. 
Furthermore, each of the surfaces can be retained by the system for any additional other analysis.  
3. Trend and Residual Surface Operations This capability provides conventional trend surfaces for the 
original raw data points, as well as the residual surface (i.e., the difference between the original 
and the trend surface), and the equation evaluationas output.  4. Statistical Surface Fitting and Smoothing 
Operations This capability provides several analytic surface fitting and/or smoothing techni­ques to 
a given surface. Smoothing of a  surface reduces the total surface varia­tion, and can, of course, 
be applied to trend surfaces as well. 5. Grid Interpolation Operations This capability provides grid 
refinements for varying the spacing of the nodes of the gridded data points to any other user specified 
value. 6. Numerical Integration Operations This capability provides areas, volumes and derivatives of 
surfaces over any of the surfaces presented by the user.  3.5 Level 5: Curve Fitting Routines Using 
least squares determination of the par­ameters of any of five mathematical functions selected by the 
user, the procedures attempts to fit both linear and nonlinear functions. The mathematical functions 
available in the package are: (1) line  (2) parabola  (3) power series  (4) asymptotic power series 
 (5) exponential   The curve fitting routines are able to interact at any level with routines from 
the other levels. The curve fitting routines are similar to the interpolation routines in that they 
fit a specific type of curve to the given points. However, these routines are peculiar in that they calculate 
the coefficients for the exact equation which was used  to plot the curve. There are five types of 
curves which can be used to fit through the data points. Since the line which isdrawn iscalculated from 
an equation whose coefficients are in turn calculated from the the given data points, the given data 
points should therefore define a curve which issimilar to that type asked for by the call to the curve 
 fitting routines. 5a) Function Types  The functions available inthis routine are 1) Line -Y=A+B-X 
represents the regression line that has slope B and y-intercept A (Fig. 3).  2) Parabola 2 represents 
the regression line that y-intercept A and a maximum or minimum (vertex) at X = -B/2C (Fig. 4). 3) 
Power -Y=AX B represents the regression line which for negative B, the curve is undefined at X=O (Fig. 
5). 4) Asymptotic-Power-Y=A-XB+C represents the regression line which for negative B, the curve isundefined 
at X=O, also the curve has a horizontal asymptotic of Y=C (Fig. 6). 5) Exponential -Y=eA+B X represents 
the regression line that has y-intercept and lies entirely in the first qua­drant (Fig. 7).  Fig. 3. 
Linear Function Fig. 4. Parabolic Function  For all functions within the routine: 5b) Selection of 
the Mathematical Model  Infitting data with this routine, care must be used in selecting the model 
for the approximation. To aid indetermining which mathematical model to use, visual techniques are 
recommended. Visual techniques, i.e., plotting, scatter dia­grams, can be extremely useful for the model 
determination. For a simple scatter diagram, plot the data points on a rectangular coordinate system. 
From the scatter diagram it is often possible to visualize a smooth curve approxima­ting the data. Furthermore, 
ifa trend is known, it is still advisable to plot the data and check the validity of any point that does 
not appear to follow the trend established by the majority of the data points. 4.0 SUMMARY A user-oriented 
Computer Graphics System (CGS) has been described, which primarily has been designed to aid the application 
programmer, and not just the sophisticated computer graphics user. The system has been designed to provide 
a very simple interaction capability, where the inter­action is based on a variety of input devices and 
a simple input/output graphics command lan­ guage. The result of this system has been an increase in 
programming efficiency, reduction in span time from creations of design to actual implementation. Typical 
application developments have included such system as flowcharting systems, Computer Aided Architectural 
Space Planning, Animation, Vehicle-PedestrianInteractions, Computer-aideddesigns, and the simulation 
of the NASA Space Shuttle.

 A CCNVERSATIONAL EXTENSIBLE SYSTEM FOR THE ANIMATION OF SHADED IMAGES(*) by  Ronald M. Baecker Dynamic 
Graphics Project, Computer Systems Research Group University of Torcnto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Abstract 
 The terms "conversational" and "extensible" are defined and shown to be useful properties of computer 
animation systems. A conversational extensible system for the animation of shaded images is then described. 
With this system, implemented on a minicomputer, the animator can sketch images and movements freehand, 
or can define them algorithmically via the Smalltalk language. The system is itself implemented in Smalltalk, 
and hence can be easily extended or mcdified to suit the animator's personal style. (*) This work was 
supported primarily by the Xerox PaloAlto Research Center. I. Introduction Computer animation consists 
of a variety cf techniques and processes in which the computer is used as an aid in the production of 
animated sequences [Halas 74, Wein 74]. Computer animation systems can generally be classified as either 
algorihmic or demonstrative [Tilson 75]. 1. Programming-language based systems (Algorithmic systems) 
 EEFLIX [Knowlton 64], EXFLOR [Knowlton 7C], and ZAPP (Guerin 73, Eaecker 76], reuire the animator to 
describe a movie in a written programming language. These systems generally are not interactive; the 
arimator is provided no direct visual feedback. 2. Interactive systems based on freehand sketching (Demcnstrative 
systems) GENESYS [Eaecker 69a,69b,70a], ARTA  [Mezei 71], and the Eurtnyk-Wein system [Eurtnyk 71a,71b] 
allow the animator to sketch images and movements free-hand. These systems generally provide immediate 
real time playback of the resulting movie. Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all 
of this work or personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or 
distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation 
on the first page. To copy otherwise, to republish, to post on servers, or to redistribute to lists, 
requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. Siggraph 76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania We 
shall now focus upon the second category cf systems. The strengths of GENESYS lay in the spontaneous, 
real time interaction it facilitated, and in the ccnceptualization of the computer animated film and 
the filmmaking process that it embodied. The heart of this conceptualization was a duality between image 
and movement, and a rich set of representations for movement and tools for the constructionof movement. 
The ARTA and Eurtnyk-Wein systems demonstrated the utility of various picture construction and transformationtools, 
including the ability to interpolate between images (key frame animation). By 1969, one could identify 
several major weaknesses in these systems: 1. They were rigid, difficult to modify and extend.  2. 
The animator could draw images and movements, but could not compute them directly; he had a fixed set 
of drawing commands, not an open-ended programming and drawing system at his fingertips.  3. Image quality 
was poor, consisting of  black-and-white dot and line drawings, lacking levels of tone, texture, and 
color. In the pericd 1969-1974, there were several useful developments addressing these problems. Burtnyk 
and Wein focused upcn the problem of image quality [Burtnyk 73], succeeding to the point that Peter 
Fcldes was able to make his Cannes award­winning film HUNGER [Foldes 74]. Richard Shcup and Robert Flegal 
at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed a rich color video system, and produced numerous 
striking examples of directly sketched or ccmputed color video [Shoup 74]. In Alan Kay's Learning Research 
Group (IRG) at Xerox PARC, the Smalltalk language was developed and shown to be a viable and congenial 
host for the development of user­responsive programs [Kay 72,74; LRG 76]. Experiments with freehand painting 
programs demonstrated the viability of black and white TV generated by a minicomputer as a medium for 
shaded drawings. Finally, the now legendary Pegasus-CookieMonster movie produced using Steve Purcell's 
playback process (describedbelow) demonstrated that this same hardware could be used for the real time 
animation of these drawings. Thus, encouraged by these prior developments, and guided by a previous 
vision [Baecker 69a], until now unfulfilled,of what it would like to build arimation systems in an appropriate 
language, we developed a new animation system at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the summer of 
1974. This system successfully incorporates Purcell's real time shaded image animation capability into 
LRG's Smalltalk programming and drawing environment. SHAZAM (Smalltalk's sHaded image Zippy Animated 
Moviemaker) is a demonstrative picture-driven animation system modeled directly upon GENESYS [Eaecker 
69a,69b,70a,74]. Hence the animator need know no Smalltalk. However, the system was designed for children 
ages 8 to 15 who are learning Smalltalk [Goldberg 74], and they can compute images and movements by executing 
Smalltalk commands or by writing Smalltalk programs as easily as they can sketch them freehand. Furthermore, 
a skilled Smalltalk programmer can extend or mcdify the system himself. We shall next define the terms 
"conversational" and "extensible", and discuss the relevance of these language features to computer 
animation. These arguments constitute a concise and sharper presentation of points originally made 
in [Eaecker 69a]. Key aspects of the design and implementationof SHAZAM will then be presented; the 
relevance of ccnversaticnalityand extensibility will be stressed, and some directions for future research 
proposed.  II. Cn Conversaticnalityand Extensibility in Animation Systems In concluding its discussion 
of picture-drivenanimation, and in motivating the design of the Animation and Picture ProcessingLanguage 
(APPL), Eaecker [69a] noted: "We have seen that there are advantages and disadvantages to each of several 
approaches to the definition of dynamic pictures--the construction of individual frames, the algorithmic 
generation of sequences of frames, and picture-driven animation. This suggests that a flexible animation 
system would allow the harmonious blending of all these techniques. Here GENESYS fails a priori, fcr 
it makes inaccessible the full ccmputaticnal power of the computer. within the language of GENESYS cne 
cannot implement algorithms by writing programs. We have also seen that GENESYS is inadequate because 
it presents the animator with a fixed set of commandsand tools, with fixed mechanisms cf control, and 
with fixed models cf pictures and of processes of picture construction. A suitably skilled animator may 
himself determine these aspects cf his animation system, his arimation-machine, only if the system is 
not a fixed set of commands but an extensible, truly open-ended programming language." The design of 
APPI, and the construction of SHAZAM in Smalltalk, were intended to demonstrate the feasibility and attractivenessof 
unifying algorithmic and demonstrative computer animation capabilities in one system. (A similar goal 
is pursued by [de Fanti 73].) For this tc be possible, APPL had to be (and Smalltalk is) conversational 
and extensible. These terms are much used and misused in the literature, so we shall now define our use 
of them quite precisely. A. Ccnversationality The terms "conversational","on-line", and "interactive" 
are often used interchangeably when applied to computer systems. our usage shall be more restrictive. 
A conversational language is one in which: 1. "Response time is proportional to the demand for computation 
and, in particular, there is rapid response tc trivial requests" [Standish 70].  2. The language is 
conveniently extendable, that is, program's may be written in the same language with which cne expresses 
direct commands to the system, and they may be immediately tested.  3. The animation environment or 
data base is directly accessible at all times.  The response time criterion is important for computer 
animation because of the frequency with which animators make and wish to preview the effect of small 
changes tc their movies. Such changes typically include speeding up or slowing down a motion, introducing 
or removing an object a split second earlier or later, and making slight pcsitional changes to an object. 
 Compiled languages operating in card­ oriented slcw-turnaround batch systems (the antithesis of a conversational 
system) impede the animator's ability and desire to carry out such refinements to a movie. The extendibility 
criterion is important for computer animation because demonstrative systems rarely have the perfect 
command set and the perfect interaction style for every animator. Although a system can be changed 
even if the implementationlanguage is very remote from the user command language, the dialogue between 
animator and animation system programmer can be enhanced if the twc languages are the same. Furthermore, 
 the animator can ultimately learn to make simple additions and modifications by himself. The environment 
accessability criterion is important for computer animation because animation computations often yield 
interesting pictures or movements as by-products. It is of course possible to anticipate these and 
explicitly modify any animation program to write them onto a file. But such results are often unanticipated, 
even the result of accidents, and one wants to be able to access them at any time using the same naming 
conventions as are used by the animation program. Conversational systems satisfying these criteria 
include most LISP, LOGO, API, and BASIC implementations, and Smalltalk. These systems generally are interpretive, 
but they need not be; the same results could be achieved by incremental compilation. B. Extensibility 
 One recent definition of extensibility has been provided by Cheatham [71]: "By extensible programminglanguage 
we mean a base (or core) language plus a programming system the totality of which has facilities for 
extending or modifying:(1) the syntax of programs; (2) the operators available; (3) the data structures 
and internal representations of data structures which can be defined, given values, manipulated, output, 
and so on: and, (4) the regimes of control which can be employed".  Extensibility of operators, data 
 structures, and regimes of control are relevant to computer graphics in general  and to computer animation 
in particular [Eaecker 70b, Standish 70]. A data definition facility in an  extensible language enables 
the specification of a composite data type (data structure) built out of primitive  data types and/or 
other composite data structures. The extended language must contain mechanisms for constructing members 
 of the new class from suitable components (constructors), mechanism for selecting distinguished components 
(selectors), and mechanisms for testing if an arbitrary datum belongs to the new class (predicates). 
Standish [67] presented a formalism and a methodology for augmenting a language with a data definition 
facility so that, given a new data structure definition, the system can automatically provide the 
associated constructors, selectors, and predicates. Furthermore, these constructors, selectors, and 
 predicates are used in formulating extensions of the meaning of old operators so that they apply to 
new data types. (Adding new operators can be done via function definitions in most procedural languages, 
although these language enhancements may be made more gracefully if coupled with the syntax extension 
 capabilities of an extensible language.) In computer animation we often encounter classes of pictures 
or data which possess unique characteristicfeatures, and specialized techniques for their construction, 
decomposition and manipulation. P-curves, waveforms, selection description, and rhythm descriptions [Baecker 
69a,69b] are some examples. An extensible animation language allows us to define these new concepts gracefully 
while remaining within the same language. The same kind of argument applies to extensibilityof control 
structure. One good example is quasi-parallelprocessing. Simulation is the mathematical dynamic modelling 
of a hypothetical or real system; animation is the pictural dynamic modelling of a hypothetical or real 
system [Baecker 69a]. Hence an animation language must allow several strands of activity to proceed concurrently, 
synchronously or asynchronously. Similar cases can be made fcr other control regimes such as semaphores 
[Horsley 74, Duff 76] and continuously evaluating expressions. As with data structures, greater flexibility 
can be achieved if new control structures can be defined by extending a set of control primitives with 
an appropriate definition facility [Fisher 70]. III. A ConversationalExtensible Animation System  
A. The Essential Features of Smalltalk  [Goldberg 75] describes Smalltalk as a programming language 
that: "...permits detailed examinations of the processes involved in carrying out a task. It is a communication 
medium based on sending and receiving messages among objects. No exceptions exist to this notion. Everything 
in Smalltalk is an object; actions occur as a result of sending a message to an object; an object understands 
a message according to the way it receives the message; and objects are grouped in classes because of 
the similarity of their description and the sameness of the actions they can take. Each member of a class 
remembers information that distinguishes it from the other members of the class, but each member receives 
and sends messages according to the class definition". Any class definition in Smalltalk follows the 
same skeletal pattern: to class_name tempcrary_vars object_vars 1 class_vars (acticns of_any_member_of_the_class) 
 Class variables are those whose meaning (binding) applies to all objects of the class, object variables 
are those whose meaning is unique to a particular object (instance of the class), and temporary variables 
are those that are created and destroyed anew in any activation of any object of any class. When an object 
is activated (fired up, called), it carries out the actions contained in the body of the class definition. 
 The concepts of class and object embodied in Smalltalk are similar to (in fact, inspired by) those contained 
in SIMULA [rahl 72]. But the concept of sending and receiving messages is significantly different from 
that of passing arguments and binding them to procedure parameters. Each class definition contains specifications 
which determine when it chooses to receive a message and how it will interpret that message. In particular, 
it may receive a message literally (unevaluated), it may receive and evaluate a message in its own environment, 
or it may receive and evaluate a message in the environment of the message transmitter (retrieve a binding 
from that environment). These mechanisms fcr controlling evaluation are similar to but more general than 
those provided in LISP.  Like LISP and LOGO, Smalltalk is ccnversational. Smalltalk furthermore shares 
with LISP the property that Smalltalk program segments (code vectors) are data objects within the language. 
Thus Smalltalk programs can easily construct or modify other Smalltalk programs, which is a tool of great 
power (although perhaps one easily misused). Smalltalk also shares with ICGO some properties that facilitate 
its use by children, who are the prime intended users of both languages. These features include a straightforwardsyntax 
requiring no declarations, and the simple graphics sublanguage turtle geometry. Experiences with both 
languages demonstrate that children begin composing procedure definitions (class definitions) in their 
first hour on the machine. E. SHAZAM's Basic Capabilities and Interaction Style SHAZAM contains only 
the most essential animation capabilities. This is in order to facilitate its learning by children, who 
use it for making small movies. Another reason is that more scphisticated features can easily be added 
by extension. Static images in SHAZAM are called  cels. They resemble the cels cf. the animation industry, 
in that they behave like clear sheets of celluloid which can be "painted" and overlaid. Commands exist 
to paint cels, to erase them totally, to copy a cel, and to cycle through all available cels for review 
and possible insertion into a movie. Cels are painted using "brushes" which can have different shapes 
and which can be "dipped" into different "paints". Commands exist to select one of a number of brushes 
(such as a pin or a blob), and one of a number of paints (such as black, grey, white, or transparent). 
The effect of these brushes and paints may be seen in some typical SHAZAM drawings shown in Figures 1 
and 2.  Dynamic images in SHAZAM are called  movies. A movie consists of a sequence of cel selections 
(selection description), which determines which cel is visible in which frame, and a sequence of positions 
(F-curve), which determines where the selected cel is located in each frame. Commands exist to sketch 
a p-curve, to select a cel fcr a particular frame, to single step through the movie (advance one frame 
at a time), and to play back the movie (cycle it continuously). As was true using GENESYS, the SHAZAN 
animator can create a movie such as the dripping faucet of Figure 3 in 5 minutes of work with the p-curve, 
selection description, single step, and real-time playback capabilities.  Every cel and every movie 
is affiliated with its own unique window. Commands exist to reposition both the cel (movie) and window 
relative to the screen, tc move the window relative to the cel (mcvie), and to expand or shrink the window. 
Cels and movies are viewed through their windows, which are drawn as dark black outlines and which occlude 
material falling outside their boundaries. Composite movies such as those in Figures 4 and 5 may be 
formed by activating individual movies, positioning them on the screen, and controlling their appearance 
by changing the location and size of their surrounding windows. Figure 3 Figure 4 SHAZAM continues 
to execute in  parallel with the playback process as it displays one or more movies. Thus the sketching 
of a cel can occur concurrently with a playback of a movie in which that cel is used. Defining a blinking 
pair (two frame movie) using this feature provides a vivid demonstration of the Phi Phenomenon on which 
the illusion of animation is based. One constructs, for example, a two frame movie consisting of a bent 
arrow and an undefined cel, fires up the movie playback process, and then begins to sketch a straight 
arrow as the second cel. At first the movie is only a mechanical alternation between two static images, 
but, as the second cel begins to take shape, the movie suddenly comes to life as an energetic flexible 
arrow. (Figure 6)  Figure 6 pointing device such as a stylus. Aside from typing in mov ie names so 
that they may be saved on a di sk, all SHAZAM input is given from a hardware Cel and  movie windows 
each contain a menu of command icons (light buttons). Pointing at a particular icon causes the associated 
ccmmand to be activated. For example, pointing at a tiny palette activates painting; pointing at a tiny 
staircase causes the movie to single step. Each window's command icons appear (disappear) when the 
stylus enters (leaves) that window. Positioning or scaling of windows is done by "dragging" them with 
the stylus. All windows also have a "vertical location"; this layering causes some pcrticns of pictures 
to be occluded by others. A window can be "brought to the top" by depressing the tip of the stylus while 
it is within that window but not pointing at any command icon. C. The SHAZAM Playback Processor Use 
of SHAZAM results in the ccnstructicn of a tree of Smalltalk objects. These objects are instances of 
some Smalltalk classes all of which respond tc the message 'display'. This tree structure may be regarded 
as a display file. There is also a special program which accepts a pointer to the root of the tree and 
passes the message 'display' down it; this program may be considered a display processor. Primitive 
pictures in SHAZAM are defined as 256x256 rasters of points, each black, white, or transparent. They 
are stored in a highly compact form, using a hierarchic area encoding scheme, so that a number of pictures 
can fit into memory together. The display processor traces the tree structure, scan converts, translates 
clips, and does transparency-opacity calculations (to determine which portions of which layers are visible) 
in real time, approximately 3 to 10 frames per second. The results of these calculations are double buffered 
to the video display to enhance the perception of movement. D. Conversationalityin SHAZAM Smalltalk 
is an interpretive system implemented on a stand-alone minicomputer; it provides "rapid response to trivial 
requests". Hence it meets the response time criterion for a conversationalsystem. The extendibility and 
environment accessability criteria are also satisfied; their importance to SHAZAM, however, is somewhat 
subtler. The extendibility criterion is perhaps best discussed by relating an anecdote. The incident 
occurred while Eric Martin, a non-programming animator, was working with SHAZAM shortly after it became 
operational. Eric requested that SHAZAM be modified to allow one to replicate a cel in multiple frames 
of a movie with a single command. This is particularly useful if one is ccnstructing cyclic motions. 
Because of Smalltalks's convenient extendibility, I was able tc add this feature in fifteen minutes. 
Furthermore, I was able to explain what I was doing, enhancing Eric's appeciation of possible system 
malleability in terms of his nascent understanding of Smalltalk. (Note: It is essential that a computer 
animator develop an ability to sense which aspects of a system's limitations are arbitrary and which 
are fundamental.) I contrast this experience to similar incidents with the use of GENESYS, in which I 
could add such a feature only overnight, and in which it was impossible tc explain to the animator what 
I was doing in terms of what he was doing. The role of environment accessability for SHAZAM is equally 
dramatic. In GENESYS every access path to the animation data base had to be pre-planned and pre­programmed. 
These included such trivial functions as: retrieve a picture, given its name; retrieve the X coordinate 
of a particular cel in a particular frame of a particular movie; and, reverse the direction of movie 
playback. These functions, and many more, all come "for free" in SHAZAM because they may be expressed 
simply and directly in terms of the Smalltalk evaluator's mechanisms for retrieving and establishirg 
bindings. Furthermore, by cleverly including calls to the Smalltalk evaluator at appropriate points within 
interesting class definitions, one can interrogate and modify the local state of a particular instance 
of that class. The experienced SHAZAM animator can exploit this to explore and refine individual movies. 
 E. The Extensibility of SHAZAM Available space precludes the presentation of a complete description 
of the method and style of Smalltalk extensions. Extensions of the operators, of the syntax, of data 
structures, and of ccntrol structures, may all be achieved. The Smalltalk class concept, like that of 
SIMULA, subsumes both procedures and data structures as they appear in conventional languages. Hence 
new data structures may be defined as easily as and in the same manner as new functions. The design 
of the final version of  SHAZAM followed a pattern that seems to characterize the development of many 
 Smalltak programs. First, the essential Smalltalk classes, such as the cel, the movie, the window, 
and the menu, were identified. Next,the necessary local state of each instance of each class was specified, 
and appropriate instance variables defined. Then, the messages appropriate to each class were formulated. 
 Finally, code carrying out the response to those messages was written. IV. Conclusions References 
 One particularly useful consequence of Smalltalk conversationality and extensibility is that an animation 
system designer way formulate, implement in preliminary fashion, test the viability of, and, if need 
be, discard numerous design ccncepts. The version of SHAZAM described in this paper is literally the 
fourth that we constructed in three man-months of effort. Each of the first three implementations explored 
 a point of view with respect to embedding picture-driven animation within Smalltalk. Although none 
were completed, each trial implementation yielded useful insights which were ultimately incorporated 
into the final design. I know of no other environment where design ideas can be explored with ccmparable 
grace and fluidity. luckily, SHAZAM is a relatively small  system, because large systems constructed 
in this environment often run slowly, and must therefore be reprogrammed in less powerful but more efficient 
languages. The utility of conversational extensible graphics languages will obviously be enhanced if 
appropriate tools for performance measurement and analysis and  for compilation are developed. Another 
area for future research is  the development of more general techniques fcr coupling free-hand and algorithmic 
 specifications in computer animation. SHAZAM takes a step in this direction by allowing both cels and 
p-curves to be sketched or computed, but the underlying playback process is fixed, inaccessible to 
the Smalltalk programmer. Animation computation and playback processes should  be expressible with 
all the powers of the conversational extensible graphics language; techniques for combining these processes 
and for enabling them to compute  efficiently must be developed. Acknowledgements The implementation 
of SHAZAM was carried out by the author and Tom Horsley while working in the Learning Research Group 
(LRG) of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Eric Martin provided many useful ideas and suggestions, 
and was the system's first user. The very elegant design of the windows is Tom's, inspired in part by 
a previous implementation of Alan Kay's. The display processor is the work of Steve Purcell, also inspired 
(I believe) by a suggestion of Alan Kay's. Weare  especially grateful to Steve and to Dan Ingalls,

 Three generally accepted facts are: 1. Computers are getting cheap and fast enough to do cost-effectivegraphics 
on line  and in real time;  2. The future of computer graphics is in raster scan;  3. Computer animation 
is emerging as  a volatile art form and as a medium for scientific communication. Concurrently, we 
find computer animation somewhat polluted and distorted by 1. The illusionary immediacies of analog 
techniques;  2. The line gestalt of computer output microfilm;  3. The transformational paradigm of 
the 4 by 4 matrix.  In contrast, this paper dwells on on-line, real-time, color rasterscan, digital 
techniques and associated videotapes. Accompanyingillustrations present the specific application of a 
"veridical memory" approach to computer graphics, distinguished from other similar ef­ forts by: 1. 
A 90 nano-second,writable control store;  2. Noncontiguous and variable bits per pixel;  3. Minicomputer 
support of PL/1, LISP, and LOGO;  4. Advanced graphical input techniques;  5. Hardware priorities indigenous 
to cell animation;  6. Production of color hard copy.  Results indicate an opportunity for complex 
descriptions and displays 1. In which the message is not the medium;  2. Through which color assumes 
a new role;  3. With which the user works without a typeable genre;  4. About which our wildest fantasies 
offer only modest extrapolation.  Inasmuch as our work on animation is just beginning, this paper does 
not take a rigorous posture. Instead, we submit a collage of output, classify some of our errors, and 
outline likely solutions. * This work on computer animation is being sponsored jointly by I.B.M. and 
the Division of Computer Research of the National Science Foundation (Grant number DCR74-20974-A01). 
The work employs hardware built under prior Office of Naval Research contract number N00014-67-A-0204-0074. 
 INTRODUCTION Computer animation is both a subset and a superset of computer graphics. It is a subset 
inasmuch as it implies an application. It is a superset in that all computer graphics is animation, either 
in the sense of dynamics or of frame composition. One result of this duality is that the community of 
researchers working on computer animation techniques is composed of people with interests spread across 
a wide spectrum, ranging from hardware gadgetry to programming languages, from basic color theory to 
soap-suds commercials. Another result is that the literature available frequently reads like a Leibniz 
argument working back from the details of an electronic circuit or of a graphical keyframe to the best 
of all possible worlds. The purpose of this paper is threefold: to share conceptual errors made in and 
common to research, described in the following text; to present specific experiments and equipment through 
illustrations and diagrams; to suggest alternatives. While the errors discussed have been frequently 
the authors', in cases they are general­izable to the foolhardy mixing of modes and media, getting one 
system to do badly what another does well. In computer graphics this can be likened to the gratuitous 
efforts of making light pens into tracking devices and tablets into pointing devices. The following 
taxonomy has the curious property of being readable (almost) chronologically from left to right, as well 
as structurally from top to bottom. Parentheses surround the names of key figures and corporations in 
each area. All computer-generatedillustrations that follow are produced in the bottom right-hand vernacular 
of computer graphics: veri­dical memories (a name borrowed from IBM to avoid the static associations 
of the more popular term, frame buffer).  MISTAKE ONE: THE PROCESS/PRODUCT HANGOVER MISTAKE TWO: STYLIZED 
IMMEDIACIES Historically in film, animation is the pro­ cess of working frame by frame, where the time 
lapsed is used to move, substitute, or alter graphical elements. By definition, the composition of 
an animated movie is not in real time. However, with computers, there are classes of movement, substitu­ 
tion, and alteration that can be achieved in real time, by one brand of machine or another. In such 
cases, the product is vastly different from the traditional car­ toon, and it is a mistake to ignore 
this fact. We are reminded of a presentation given by the director of a computing center which offered 
one-or two-minute turnaround time in batch processing for "modest" programs, fast enough for users to 
march slowly around a turnstile from input to output. To offer this as a substitute for time­sharing 
was to miss completely the point of real time: interaction in general and interruptabilityin specific. 
 Similarly, real-time animation is not so much a tool for production as for inter­ action. In a proposal 
for achieving "ex­ planation through animation" in cable tele­vision, we described two stages that char­acterize 
the process/productdichotomy. The first is to allow instructors to devel­op animation sequences for inclusion 
in video material (this can be done off line). The second is to build a knowledgeable animation environment 
which can, for exam­ple, employ the principles of Newtonian physics. Here the student plays with mass 
and acceleration; builds a cast of char­acters, orchestrates scenes of rollings, crashings, and smashings. 
He interrupts and is interrupted, per force in real time. Frequently we cannot compute the content 
of a new frame in real time. We lack the bandwidth to pump digital imagery fast enough; we lack the 
computing power to figure it out in time. A result is that we build special-purposehardware like 4x4 
matrix multipliers and clippers, or we be­come distracted by convenient but meaning­less analog manipulations. 
 The real-time rotation and translation of wire-frame polyhedra in three-space has scientific uses 
for the chemist visualiz­ ing molecules, the engineer observing structures, or the designer forming 
sur­ faces. However, as an art form it is the caricature of the message as medium, boring except to 
the most uninitiated. A good question to keep asking in computer animation used as an art form is: whose 
signature is the strongest, the animator's or the display processor's? Analog techniques offer an immediacy 
in real-time difficult to achieve with digi­tal systems. However, one of two things tends to happen. 
Either the product is in the language of the Lissajous or the pro­cess is merely the computer control 
of knobs and levers of a video special­effects generator (a stretching of the term "computer animation"). 
A notable exception can be found in the excellent films of Computer Image Corporation. MISTAKE THREE: 
COLLABORATION Computer animation has had a long history of collaborations between artist and com­ puter 
person, with the assumption that art can result from an interaction in which each party knows so little 
about the other. The artist in this situation does not work in the medium of computers, but rather 
in some nebulous space limited by their mutual understandingand defined by the resulting programs. 
More recent works in graphical systems still con­ strain results and confine access to the machines' 
power. We take as a first assumption that what computers uniquely offer to the animator are process 
capabilities of embodiment and computation. Making its complete conceptual universe accessible without 
the compromise of, say, teaching LISP to artists (imagine it) has been impossible. We are constructing 
a prototype system which will provide the access without such sacrifice. Its basis is an environ­ment 
which allows definitions and manipu­lations in the visual space and the pro­cess space directly. Importantly, 
changes in the visual definition will cause changes in the process description; and, directly editing 
the process will result in a new visual experience. Ima­gine the speed of learning in the itera­tion 
between the process and the product, the form and the content. MISTAKE FOUR: THE POWER OF THE PIXEL 
 An inventor of a flat-screen television has recently developed a l"xl" picture element (pixel). What 
is surprising is that the display would be four stories high. We tend to forget the quantitative nature 
of a quarter of a million pixels per frame, each of which can consume 18 bits in red, green, blue format. 
 The flexibility of the pixel approach to computer animation is indisputable. The realities of real time 
are questionable. It may be the case that the subset of transformationsachievable pixel by pixel in real 
time is just as stultifying as the 4 by 4 matrix. While veridical memories can surely be used to animate 
experiments and simulations, it is unlikely that they will emerge as an art form to be used in real time. 
 The following pages diagram a current system and illustrate output. Below we illustrate a machine 
built purposely to explore digital approaches to video (Entwisle,1974, and Negroponte, 1976). It is 
important to observe that the bits per pixel are variable in number (current­ly up to eight) and not 
contiguous in memory.

COLUMBUS, OHIO 43212 A concept of general purpose systems which gener­ ate, store, retrieve, process

74­ 00768A01. 1. INTRODUCTION The Computer Graphics Research Group, of The Ohio State University, has 
long been interested in various uses of computers in conjunctionwith images. In searching for a general 
means with which to create, process, store and view images we have developed the concept of a general 
pur­pose image system. In our concept, such a system has a general purpose nature, a viewing mechanism,image 
storage and computer processing and uses a raster-scanformat image representa­tion. In our concept the 
general purpose nature of such a system consists of the ability to handle static and dynamic (suitable 
for the perception of motion) images of real and synthetic scenes and precludes the use of special function 
hardware. The system viewing mechanism presents static and dynamic images of informationcontent (resolution, 
 color, etc.) sufficient to trigger the desired response from the human visual system. Such a system 
is centered about the storage and retrieval of static and dynamic images to which other system functions 
such as image creation and display are subservient. Computerprocessing is used to tie the various components 
of the system together, to support the general nature of the system and to provide system functions 
which do not require a physical implementation. Raster-format image representationis used as a general 
means of handl­ing both real (digitized) and synthesized (both internal and external to the system) images. 
 Our intendeduse for the system concept described above is as an overall strategy within which to apply 
the tactics of implementating an actual system. The actual system is envisioned as being of sufficient 
generality and power to handle almost any graphical need within our area of interest. Note that our traditional 
area of interest, com­puter synthesized animation, has been expanded to include almost any use of images 
for scientific, technical and medical purposes. Our emphasis on dynamic (as opposed to static) images 
remains. I will refrain from trying to justify the "correct­ ness" of our strategy and tactics, leaving 
the issue to posterity and the usefulness (or lack thereof) of the system we build. With the above 
motivation,we are creating a digitalvideo informationstorage and retrieval system. Currentlywe are using 
a standard broad­ cast television as the viewing mechanism,a large capacity digital disk for image storage, 
a Digital Equipment CorporationPDP-11/45 minicomputer for computer processing and broadcast video for 
the raster-scan format image representation. Note that the broadcast video is not stored in composite 
NTSC format, but rather is stored as run-lengths of par­ ticular intensity-chromacombinations which 
are converted (in real time) to composite NTSC format for display. The use of run-length encoding is 
our response to the insufficiencyof current com­puter technologyto easily handle the large quan­tities 
of information implied by raster-format representationof dynamic images. Note, for example, that a raster-formatdynamic 
image of 512 by 512 resolution,8 bits per resolvable element information content, 30 frames per second 
display rate and 30 seconds duration requires over 235 millionbytes of storage. Although this formidable 
storage requirement is not prohibitive,the implied data transfer rate (8 million bytes per second) is 
prohibitivewithin our general purpose design strategy. This is due to the fact that although disks of 
over 200 million byte capacity are avail­able, the transferrate available is less than 2 million bytes 
per second. Although we feel that the "ultimate" solution will involve per resovable element (as opposed 
to run-length encoded) storage our perception of the current state of technology has resulted in our 
use of run-length encoding for the present. Since the primary issue in the implementation to date involves 
the handling of dynamic images, the current scheme of run-length encoding is emphasized in the implementationde­ 
scription below. 2. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION The part of the system currently implemented is shown in 
Figure 1. The TV is a standard Sony 19" is read from the disk, simple changes may be made in real-time 
directly to a static image buffered in main memory, etc. Further, the actual setup allows the use of 
other devices for playback, storage and manipulationof digitalvideo images. For example, a 6250 bpi, 
125 ips tape drive would be suitable. A dynamic sequence is transferredfrom the disk to the TV according 
to the following scheme. The 32KB run length buffer in Figure 2a is divided Figure 1. Digital Video 
Information portable. The run-length decoding and analog systems were constructed by Dr. John Standhammer 
and his associates (DIGITEC, Inc.; Box 5486; Raleigh, N.C. 27607). The analog system and rearend of the 
run-length decoding system are similar to an earlier system built under Stand­ hammer's direction. The 
decoding system converts our run-length format to that used in Stand­ hammer's earlier system. The resolution 
of the system is determined by the subpart with the least resolution capability, namely the TV. Thus, 
the resolutionis standard TV resolution and even though the system has 512 PIXELS along a scan line, 
an observer will never see more than about 300. The most general design goal was to allow the flexibilityusually 
associatedwith a general pur­pose digital computer. As an example of a design decisionmade on this basis 
and its consequences, consider the connection of the run-length decoding system to the rest of the computer 
system. The decoding system could have been connected directly to or set up to read directly from the 
disk. This would have avoided some of the data transfers over the UNIBUS producedby the actual setup. 
The actual setup, however, permits all of the flexi­bility usually associated with a general purpose 
peripheral. Thus, under program control a dynamic image may be transferred from the disk a static image 
may be buffered in the internal buffer of the decoding system, a static image may be buf­fered in the 
main memory of the processor,the internal buffer may be used to hold a static image while a new version 
is being calculated in main memory, the internal buffer may be used to hold a static image while another 
randomly accessed one 46 Storage and Retrieval System. into two 16KB buffers for double buffering. A 
 buffer is filled from the disk. While this buffer is being filled, informationto/from the disk controller 
from/to the CPU must be multiplexed with the data from the disk. This multiplexing is automaticallyhandled 
by the UNIBUS priority arbi­ tration unit. Fortunately,the quantity of con­ trol information necessaryto 
run the disk is a small percentage of the quantity of data being transferred. Also fortunate is the 
fact that the dual ported MOS main memory permits the instruc­ tions and associated data of the control 
program to be fetched simultaneouslywith the data being stored from disk. Thus, there are virtuallyno 
memory cycles lost directly to the control program. The buffer that is not being filled from the disk 
is being emptied into the decoding system as shown in Figure 2b. Of course, if the long-term trend of 
the disk is to be "ahead" of the 30 frame/ second rate of the TV (as is typically the case) then one 
buffer will be in the process of being emptied into the decoding system and the other will be full. The 
control program will be waiting for the buffer being emptied to be completely empty at which time it 
will read the next 16K bytes from the disk. The situation with the traffic on the UNIBUS is similar 
to the case of Figure 2a. It should be noted at this point that the situations of Figure 2a and 2b exist 
simultaneously,thus creating an incredible multiplexingproblem. How­ever, the situation will never get 
out of hand as the primary factor limiting the maximum amount of information going to the TV and, thus, 
the amount of information flowing in the various parts of the system, is the disk transfer rate. This 
rate is sufficiently slow (relatively) so that there will  Figure 2. Information Flows Through the System 
when Displaying a Dynamic Sequence. not be a problem. The complexitypermitted by the disk transfer 
rate will be analyzed in the section on dynamic image capability. As is seen in Figure 2c, information 
flowing into the run length decoding system is buffered in an internal 32KB MDS buffer before it is 
decoded. This is the reason that information may be trans­ ferred from the MDS main memorybuffer into 
the de­ coding system with no concern for field or frame boundaries. More explicitly, since field and 
 frame boundary information is contained in the data, putting off decoding the data until after informationtransfer 
permits the data to be treated as a uniform stream. The data flow through the decoding system is as 
shown in Figure 2c although it is not of particular concern here. The details of the run length format 
are given in Figure 3. Overall, this format was designedto achieve display of reasonably complex images 
given the transfer rate capabilities of the disk. The run length data formats have been created as 
"in­ structions" so that the control bits can be separated from the data and thus long strings of "low 
overhead" data have been made possible. A video sequence may be considered to be composed of a sequence 
of alternating fields. A frame is simply the result of the alternation between the two types of field. 
Consequently,there is no need for a run length instruction related to frames but there is one that specifies 
which of two types of field is to start. The format for a field specification consists of a field start 
in­struction followed by zero or more scan line specifications. Zero or more? Yes, because the field 
start instruction causes the rest of the current field to be displayed as the last speci­fied intensity-chromacombination. 
Between two start of field instructions, each scan line of a field continues until an end of line instruction 
is encountered. The rest of the line (if any) after an end of line is displayed as the last specified 
intensity-chroma combination. Intensity-chromacombinations along a scan line are specified by run type 
instructions as "modi­ fied" by previous palette loads. The decoding system contains a 256 x 15 palette. 
Each 15 bit entry may be loaded to specify any one of the 32768 intensity-chromacombinations displayable. 
 For sequences containing fewer than 257 different intensity-chromacombinations, the palette.needbe 
 loaded only once before the start of the first field. For sequences in which every individual field 
contains fewer than 257 different intensity­ chroma combinations,but the sequence as a whole contains 
more, the palette may be completelyor partially reloaded as necessarybetween fields. For fields that 
contain greater than 256 different combinations, the palette may be completely or partially reloadedwithin 
the field, although in some cases, there will be insufficient buffering in the later part of the decoding 
system to with­ stand this. Reloading within a scan line is im­practical as this implies that the average 
run length is less than two and the bufferingwill probablygive out.  3. DYNAMIC IMAGE CAPABILITY The 
calculations below are intended to give a quantative indicationof the capabilitiesof the system. It 
should be noted that these calculations are for best cases insofar as no attempt has been made to account 
for degradation due to palette loads, etc. Further, in order to provide the clearest calculations, minor 
overheads such as start of field instructions are ignored. The following calculations assume an average 
of one byte per run. This case is approached for images with (typically) fewer than 33 intensity-chroma 
 combinationswithin a scan line and fewer than 257 within a field. The disk specifications are those 
 of the manufacturer. Since the RJPO4 disk system is (relatively) the slowest part of the system, it 
 determines the maximum performance level. For con­ tiguously stored files (as video files have to be 
 in this system) the disk can be read continuously at maximum possible speed with the exception that 
 some time (7 milliseconds)is lost when changing cylinders. Since there are 19 tracks per cylinder 
and the disk requires 16.7 milliseconds for one revolution,one cylinder can be read every 317 milliseconds. 
Since 214,016 bytes are stored per cylinder, the average data transfer rate is 675 bytes per millisecond. 
Allowing 10 milliseconds for change of cylinder, 207,266 (214,016minus 6,750) bytes can be obtained 
for every cylinder read. Note that the storage space "passed over" for change of cylinder is best wasted 
as an extra revolutionwould be required to retrieve it. Thus, the average data transfer rate is 654 (207,266 
divided by 317) bytes per millisecond. Since each TV frame lasts about 33 milliseconds,this is 21,582 
bytes per frame. At one byte per run, this is 21,582 runs per frame. Since the disk has 411 cylinders 
and the system is retrieving 207,266 bytes per cylinder, there are 85,186,362 retriev­able bytes. At 
a maximum of 21,582 runs per frame, this represents 3,947 frames. Since the data is contiguous, any reduction 
in runs per frame di­rectly translates into more frames. Thus, at 2,158 runs per frame there are 39,470 
frames. The figures above are for one disk. However, each RJPO4 disk system controller is capable of 
handling eight drives. Further, a PDP-11/45 easily has suf­ficient device register space and unit load 
capa­bility to handle ten controllers. Multiplying the above figures by eighty we get a system capable 
of over 300,000 frames at over 20,000 runs per frame and over 3,000,000 frames at over 2,000 runs per 
 frame. At 30 frames per second, 3,000,000 frames represents over one day (24 hours) of video. Note 
that it is not unusual for a production computer center to have on-line disk storage capacity greater 
than that represented by eighty RPO4 drives. Unfortunately,calculations such as those above do not 
give a clear idea of the subjective image com­plexity that can be achievedby a given number of runs. 
Further, static images, as might be repro­duced with this paper, simply do not convey the proper idea. 
Consequently,all visual results have been relegated to the videotape to be shown with the presentation 
of this paper.  4. APPLICATIONS The uses of this system are many and varied. Entire libraries of static

For example, if two sequences are (detailed information about this algorithm is interleaved such that 
alternating fields are taken available from the author). We are currently from two different sequences,what 
will be per-using a second algorithm of the same general type ceived? What might this reveal about how

shown in the videotape presented with this paper. We have proposedto develop a third algorithm of the 
same generaltype which will be capable of visible surface calculating scenes of at least one million 
edges. This visible surface algorithm and the digital video informationstorage and re­trieval system 
are to be two major components of our complete system. Eventuallyour entire system concept will be 
implemented (and run length encoding replaced by per resolvable element storage). With such a system 
it should be possible to replace every piece of equipment currentlyused by the broadcast TV industry 
with the exception of cameras, trans­mitters, monitors and other real world interfaces. Video recorders, 
playback units and editors will all be able to be replacedby a general purpose system capable of all 
of the old operations plus any new ones that are programmed into the system. Perhaps most important is 
the potential improve­ment in quality. Currently, every copy (genera­tion) made of any video material 
results in degradation of the image due to noise and repli­cation inaccuracies. With a digital system 
a copy can be made exactly. Further, image enhancement may be programmed into the system to produce a 
copy of greater quality than the original  5. PROBLEMSAND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The system implementation 
described above has the problem that for some purposes the image com­ plexity achievable is insufficient. 
For example, digitized data of natural scenes essentiallyre­ quires per resolvable element storage. 
Since the lack of capability in this area violates our system concept we intend to correct the problem 
 eventually. However, this will occur only when the technologyexists to use a per resolvable element 
storage scheme. Note that we do not con­ sider the use of digitized composite video to be a solution 
as the composite format is not amenable to a general purpose system. This is due to the desire, in a 
general purpose system, to easily create and modify an image without violating the rules of the image 
format. With composite video, care must be taken to insure the integrity of the relationshipsbetween 
phase and amplitude modu­lated carriers and subcarriers and synchronization and reference signals. This 
is, at best, diffi­cult. Eventually,of course, we intend to implement our entire system concept as 
described in the intro­ duction and application sections. In regard to this it should be noted that 
we have requested major research support from the National Science Foundation. The support requested, 
if funded, will result in an essentially complete implementa­ tion of our system concept as well as the 
use of the complete system for other research.

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania INTERACTING WITH THE GALATEA FILM ANALYSIS SYSTEM* M.J. Potel 
and R.E. Sayre Department of Biophysics and Theoretical Biology and Institute for Computer Research 
University of Chicago Chicago, Illinois 60637 GALATEA is an interactive animated graphics system providing 
a tool for the man-machine analysis of moving images recorded on film. The system relies on the user's 
recognition of phenomena of interest and his manipulation of simple graphical objects to build up a 
kinegram, an animated representationof the film. Display of the kinegram superimposed on the original 
film facilitates the entry and refinement of the animation. The net re­sult is an analysis by synthesis. 
In this paper we describe the current production version of GALATEA from the standpoint of the user. 
Included are a functional description of the constituent hardware, demonstrationof various aspects of 
system behavior, and some examples of interactions common in user applications. I. INTRODUCTION GALATEA 
[3,4] has been developed for analyzing time-lapse cinemicrographic films produced in a biophysics laboratory. 
The basic idea of the system is depicted in Fig. 1. The user projects the film on a screen and uses 
a digitizing pen to indicate various features directly on the film image; in the simplest case he might 
follow a moving cell. These pen indications and the move­ments of the projector are absorbed in an appro­ 
priate manner by the computer and instantaneously fed-back as a kinegram superimposed on and synchro­ 
nized with the film image. Using further pen in­dications, the user can adjust the kinegram until it 
matches the phenomena in the film image in time and space, with the values of the parameters  Fig. 
1 -GALATEA Schematic Description  underlying the kinegram being the data output. The system supports 
a variety of measures useful in our setting, and in theory one could implement any parameterized data 
type for which meaningful input tool techniques and kinegramatic feedback can be devised. The system 
provides what may be thought of as dy­namic tracing paper for film, with which the user directly transcribes 
the features he discerns using his own sophisticatedinterpretive pattern recognition capabilities. In 
this way the system is applicable to a wide variety of areas in which film is an experimental tool, 
among them behav­ ioral psychology,weather studies, traffic flow analysis, various biomedical studies, 
automobile simulated crash studies, even team sport play analysis. Film is a useful medium in many 
such situations, not only for its time-lapse, slow­motion, and time-reversal capabilities,but par­ ticularly 
because the experiment is captured and repeatable. II. DEVICES It is helpful to begin with a discussion 
of the hardware. GALATEA involves an interface of vari­ ous components (Fig. 2) built around Digital 
 Equipment Corporation's GT44 Graphics System [5]. The CPU is a PDP-11/40 with 28K core memory. Par­ 
ticular use is made of the PDP-11's I/O bus archi­ tecture, vectored interrupts, and addressing modes. 
There are two RK05 movable head disks, capacity 1.2 megawords each, with asynchronous controller; GALATEA 
requires one entire disk for an ongoing analysis. The projector system con­ sists of a modified L-W 
International 16mm stop­ motion projector, which is controlled by a hand­ held control box and/or the 
computer. It has variable speeds up to 24 fps plus single framing.  The display processor (DPU) supports 
point, vector, and character modes, as well as variable intensity, line type, font, and blink, and 
asyn­ chronous refresh out of core. The screen coordi­ nate space is 1024-by-1024, for which there is 
 hardware clipping. With the DPU connected to a projection kinescope, the DPU-generated image and film 
image are superimposed via overhead mirroring onto a large work table. Our display interrupt handling 
supports display file sub­ routining and independent multiple channels. The main input device is ScientificAccessory 
 Corporation's Graf/Pen acoustic digitizing stylus [6, p. 178]. The pen is serially inter­faced and 
sends about 120 x,y points per second plus an up/down sense. The pen coordinate space is 2000-by-2000 
with .01" resolution. Its handler additionally supports variable degrees of smoothing, scaling, and primitive 
mechanisms such as hit and track [2,6,7]. The system includes a programmablereal-time clock running 
with an interrupt grain of 1 msec and supporting both single and repeat alarm capabilities. Finally, 
there is a Decwriter keyboard/30 cps printer. III. BEHAVIOR In this section we will describe in some 
detail the way in which the user interfaces with the system. GALATEA users typically have a film, e.g., 
a time-lapse film of several hundred amoeba-like cells moving about on an agar-covered Petri dish, from 
which they want to get a few quantitative measurements, e.g., the velocity distribution of the movements 
of several cells. The user sits at a work area onto which the com­puter-generatedimages and the film 
are projected. The various data are entered via the user's Fig. 2 - GALATEA Hardware Diagram manipulation 
of the pen within this area and, except for the projector control and infrequent typing at the keyboard, 
all system control is through pen hits on spatially-arrayeddynamic menus we call control boards [9]. 
The general properties of a pen as a digitizer are well­ suited to the primary data entry requirements 
of our application. Its specific properties as a pick [2], coupled with informative menus, are adequate 
for system control. Hence the user can easily mix data entry and system control with only small changes 
of context, i.e., by shifting his field of view and his pen motions by a few inches, from a data area 
to a system control area of the display. This alternative to the use of function switches for system 
control has worked very well for us. System control is available through the control boards, consistingof 
displayed arrays of system status information, pen-hittablepushbuttons, and pen-actuated valuators [2]. 
Since we can only display a small portion of the compositemenu at one time, we effectively partition 
access to the system status parameters which the user can con­ trol. We can think of the boards as windows 
onto a system control space which can be mapped as in Fig. 3. Such a partitioning has the disadvantage 
 Fig. 3 - Map of Control Space that not all control parameters are immediately accessible, with "meta-acts" 
required to change partitions. It has the advantage that it can be used to force the completion of complex 
status changes which must be treated as "critical sec­tions." Additionally,because we can find natural 
hierarchies of desirable acts, we can arrange the control boards in a corresponding hierarchy, thereby 
providing a useful organiza­tion for the user. Partitioning the user's possible system control acts 
also has important advantages for the imple­mentation of GALATEA in terms of both real-time processing 
and core allocation. At any time the system is only required to be able to respond to a few possible 
user acts. The primary partition, between Setup and Analysis, is based on the imple­ mentation strategy 
that only one instance of one data type (see Section IV) can be used for data entry at one time; this 
particular instance is said to be active in Analysis. To change active instances the user must move 
to Setup. Only in Setup mode are system control parameters acces­ sible, e.g., the active instance choice, 
or the cursor display option. The kinegram is not dis­played in Setup and it is easy for the system 
to keep up with a string of user commands, which occur only at interactive rates (time between events 
from 100 msec. up to many seconds). In Analysis, the system must meet the difficult real­ time constraints 
of displaying the kinegram and receiving new data. Since only one instance is accessible, core, processing 
time, and the dis­play area can be dedicated to the tasks of dis­playing the kinegram and entering data 
for the active instance. When in Analysis the user views the kinegram and can alter it or add to it 
by his manipulationof the active instance using some appropriate input tool. For example, the user may 
choose that the pen is to behave as the enter tool in relation to an instance of the Moving Points data 
type. An instance of Moving Points can be thought of as a partial function from t, the frame number 
 into x,y, the screen coordinates of the point (0<x<1023; 0sys1023), with each func­tional element defined 
only when it has been explicitly entered by the user's actions with the enter tool. The behavior of the 
enter tool is simply that, for the current value of t as determined by the projector, the x and y coordi­nates 
are determinedby the pen, whenever the pen is being pressed down in the data area (Fig. 4). Typically 
the film and the pen are both moving, with the effect that a new x,y value is sampled for each frame. 
Since the x,y value is updated periodically whenever the pen is down, the enter tool also handles cases 
in which the user wishes to enter or re-enter an x,y value for a fixed frame. Fig. 4 depicts what the 
 user sees when in Analysis with Moving Point instance number 2 (MP #2) active, and a current film frame 
number of 27. The kinegram is dis­played in the data area, onto which the film image gets overlaid; only 
one item, a previously entered MP #1, is in the kinegram for frame 27. Fig. 4 indicates that the pen 
is in the data area and is pressed down, hence the element (27,400,500)will be entered for MP #2. In 
the context of Fig. 4 the user's only options are to enter MP #2 in the above manner or to select one 
of the buttons in the control area by pressing the pen within its perimeter. For ex­ ample, hitting 
the "delete" button changes the status of the pen from an enter tool to a delete tool. The selection 
of the delete tool would then be indicated by the heavy outlining shifting from the "enter" box to 
the "delete" box. While on frame 27 the behavior of the delete tool is merely to remove the (27,400,500) 
entry for MP #2 whenever the pen is pressed down, independent of the pen's x,y location. To delete 
a region of the kinegram for MP #2 (e.g., frames 27-100), one would hold the pen down while moving 
the film through that region. In the Analysis context of Fig. 4 the user has access only to MP #2. 
To access another instance or type the user presses the pen down on the "Setup" pushbutton, causing 
the system to return to the Setup mode. In Setup he can choose to ac­ cess a new instance or make other 
"high level" changes to the system status, e.g., changing his mode of controlling the projector, altering 
the intensity of the kinegram display, etc. Having hit the "Setup" pushbutton (Fig. 4), the user will 
see the Main Board (Fig. 5), from which he can move to other contexts displayed as boards within Setup. 
Within Setup the user acts prim­ arily by pushing buttons. Hitting a button flanked by arrows (e.g., 
the "Analysis"button in Fig. 5), causes a move to another board. From the Main Board the user might 
move to the Quick Setup Board (Fig. 6), on which he might activate a new data type or instance and 
hit the "Analysis" button to return to Analysis, where the newly active instance could then be manipulated. 
 Fig. 5 - Main Board Fig. 6 - Quick Setup Board Fig. 4 - Moving Point Entry The display of the pushbuttons 
also serves to in-dicate key parameters of the system status. For example, if MP #27 is active the Quick 
Setup Board will appear as in Fig. 6. The fact that MP is the currently active type is noted by the heavy 
out-line on the "Moving Points" pushbutton. Within the MP type the instance number may be altered by 
hits on the "next" or "previous" buttons. Another type may be chosen, say, by a hit on the "Sketches" 
pushbutton. Because the status dis-play is so closely tied to the locus of the user's actions, he senses 
in a natural way that he has successfully hit a particular button; on hitting "Sketches" the heavy outline 
appears on that button and disappears from the "Moving Points" button. IV. GRAPHICAL DATA TYPES We now 
turn our attention to the graphical data types in GALATEA, the basic abstract entities with which the 
user works. The user relates to each instance of a data type in three ways: (1) the data aspects define 
the numerical values he will get out of the system; (2) the input or tool aspects define the paradigm 
within which he uses the pen and projector control to bind data to the data instance; (3) the display 
aspects govern the appearance of the instance's kinegra-matic feedback. We will briefly discuss some 
of these aspects for each of the graphical data types implemented in GALATEA. These types often duplicate 
and extend techniques used previously in our brute-force frame-by-frame analysis and subsequent data 
reductions. Counters -The counters data type extends the use of hand-held counters. Each instance con- 
sists of a set of integers, representing hit- indicated increment or decrement of multi-bin counts. Intervals 
-The Intervals data type extends the use of stopwatches. Each instance may be thought of as a binary 
(on/off) function of film frames. Two tools may be used: like a stopwatch, on (off) in frames passed 
through between pairs of hits; or a holddown, on (off) in frames passed through while pen is held down. 
Space-Time Events -Each instance of Space-Time Events consists of a set of x,y,t (t=frame number) triples. 
Each triple is hit-indicated (defined as the x,y,t value at the instant of pen tran- sition to down), 
and is represented by a cross at point x,y in frame t. The Space-Time Events are used in various conceptual 
ways: to in-dicate events, locations of phenomena, etc.; as an alternative for Counters and Intervals; 
in pairs (or groups of n) to indicate distance (perimeter, etc.), extending the use of rulers; and also 
as a means for transcribing plots. Moving Points -Each instance of a Moving Point consists of a partial 
function from frame numbers into x,y pairs (thus 0 or 1 pairs per frame). The Moving Point tool is the 
tracking mechanism, defined as sampling the most recent x,y point in a frame while the pen is down. Moving 
Points usually display as either a single point or as a box (useful in our application for following 
moving cells). Moving Points are often used to determine velocities of objects and other time-dependent 
measures on which subsequent time-series analyses are made. Animations -This facility provides a way 
to com-pose an object out of simpler types. Initially we simply have a way of specifying pair-wise line 
connection of Moving Points. The facility is used primarily for analyzing moving wave fronts or changing 
shapes. Now being incorporated are ways to turn (parts of) an Animation on or off as specified by an 
Interval and using Moving Points to bind locations in a Sketch, Sketches -This facility provides a means 
to enter free-hand drawings, using points, vectors, charac-ters, intensity, line type, blink, etc., to 
form a static sketch that may appear in any frames desired (as indicated in a manner similar to Intervals). 
Sketches are used to outline objects (say, for subsequent measurement of area), to have alphanumeric 
titling, or for auxiliary figures (e.g., to aid counting transitions into and out of areas, or as a way 
to remember previous positions of objects) . Titles -The Titles data type provides the same facility 
as in Sketches for positioned. frame-wise extant, alphanumeric strings, for-purposes of labelling, demonstration 
aids, etc. Titles are included as a separate data type so as to use a particularly efficient specification 
and internal representation. Circular Waves -This is an example of a higher-level data type specific 
to our application. Each instance of a-Circular Wave represents a circle expanding with constant radial 
velocity, and is parameterized by an x,y space origin (hit-indicated) a time origin (hit-indicated, usually 
with the film running backwards) , and radial velocity (track-indicated). One could also use the double 
vector tool, i.e., enter two distinct tracks and extrapolate the space-time origin, particularly for 
off-the-film centers. Depending upon the given application, such complex data types may be preferable 
for their detailed kine-gramatic feedback. Users are likely to need quite different mixes of data types, 
often just one type in considerable quantity. For this reason, the system dynamically allocates space 
for types as they are used. Cer-tain data types, the global types Counters, Ani-mations, and Circular 
Waves, are maintained in core (during Analysis). Here a IK table has proved adequate with room for, say, 
200 Circular Waves, et c . All other data types, the local types are dynamically allocated in disk pages 
171, for example, providing room for 121 Moving Points in every frame of a 3600 frame (-100 ) film. V. 
APPLICATIONS In this section we describe some ways in which the various GALATEA capabilities may be brought 
to bear on film analysis problems. We will draw all our examples from problems arising in our develop-mental 
biology research, but the ideas transfer easily to the other film analysis contexts mentioned earlier. 
We will begin with a discus- sion of standard digitization techniques and fol- low with several examples 
of more novel techni- ques possible with GALATEA. The digitization techniques that may be considered 
standard are embodied in Moving Points and Space-Time Events, which were the first data types to be implemented. 
The tools, track and hit, underlying these two data types exist in some form on most commercially available 
digitizing devices. We have used the Moving Point data type extens-ively to digitize cell and other motions. 
Typi-cally the resulting data are first used to make plots of distance vs. time or velocity vs. time. 
Moving Point data sets, consisting as they do of complete time behaviors, are usually then re-duced with 
respect to aspects of interest. Often the goal is to look for particular features in cell motion (e.g., 
the beginning of a certain motile response), or in what overall direction a cell moves, or with what 
frequency periodic motions take place. It is common to look for correlations among different cell behaviors, 
particularly patterns of related response, Vary-ing degrees of statistical analyses are applied to these 
problems. Usually this involves sununa-rizing statistics, correlations, linear regres-sions, Fourier 
transforms, and simple hypothesis testing, all user-written and running on our mini-computer. In some 
cases more involved statistics are needed, particularly various time-series analyses, multivariate regressions, 
cluster analysis, etc. for which the data are sent to our computing center (see Section VI), for processing 
by the powerful stat packages available there. The Space-Time Event data type is valuable primar-ily 
because it is based on user controlled samp-ling. Since the set of data values obtained is specifically 
indicated by the user, he can embed various semantics in his sampling method. Thus, pairs of Space-Time 
Events may be intended to measure distance, or sets to denote counts and the like. Moreover, the samplings 
can be used to indicate times, and hence in groups to specify occurrences of periodic events or in pairs 
to measure time intervals. Space-Time Events provide an alternative way to effect some of the measure-ments 
usually made with Moving Points; for ex-ample, the velocity of an object may be inferred from several 
Space-Time Event indications of its location. Furthermore, these are easier to make precisely, representing 
instants when the user feels he can specify the space-time positions with greatest confidence. The economy 
of Space-Time Events tends to lessen the need for reduc-tion by statistical techniques. There are also 
several auxiliary uses of Space-Time Events, including the insertion of fiducial marks to indicate times 
and extents of registration shifts or realignments of the projected image, as a time pick to set the 
value of a tab or margin (see Section VI), etc. We turn now to more advanced analysis techniques possible 
with GALATEA, presenting several speci-fic examples. The first of these involves ani-mating wave fronts. 
Among the various phenomena exhibited by the principal organism studied in our laboratory (the cellular 
slime mold,Dictyostelium discoideum [8]) is an expanding; approximately circular wave-like motion of 
response through sheets of cells, for which the Circular Wave data type was developed. Suppose we wished 
to study this wave with Animations, as we must for the variety of non-circular waves. One would be-gin 
by using Moving Points to follow the wave front out radially from its center (Fig. 7). Then, by using 
the Animation facility to connect Fig. 7 -Entry of Tenth MP Tracking Wave these pair-wise (and blanking 
the Moving Points themselves), the user achieves an animation of the global behavior of the wave (Fig. 
8). The data from the underlying Moving Points are of interest, say for testing the hypothesized constant 
radial velocity of the wave. Or one may use Space-Time Events to mark the collision of two such waves 
from different centers, or Intervals to measure the period between successive waves from the same center, 
and so on. The Animation may also pro-vide the feedback used while entering the under-lying Moving Points. 
Thus, the user might connect up his Animation first, blank the Moving Points, Fig. 8 -Animation Connecting 
MPs of Fig. 7 and enter each Moving Point with an eye to making the Animation lines tangent to the wave. 
An important notion concerning the way in whichthe system is often used is that the user buildsup the 
composite kinegram over a period of timein digitizing the many phenomena in a section offilm (Fig. 9). 
By exploiting the system's ability to blank various data instances, connect up vari­ous alternatives 
for Animations, change display  Fig. 9 -Composite Kinegram variants, intensities, and the like, the 
user can view different subsystems in different ways as hisongoing observations suggest. He may compare 
andcontrast alternatives for capturing the phenomenaof interest, measure data with respect to thekinegram 
itself, and in general use the systemas a conceptualizing device. The next examole demonstrates the use 
of the Sketches facility to provide auxiliary figures * to aid subsequent data entry. In studying earlystages 
of development in chick embryos, the re­lation between structures called somites formingalong an axial 
line and an earlier coaxial motionof an object called Hensen's node is of interest.The user begins later 
in the film after the so­mites are well-formed and uses the Sketches facility to mark their location 
with points or with lines as in Fig. 10. Then, returning to anearlier point in the film, he enters with 
Space-Time Events the time of movements of Hensen's node with respect to these lines (Fig. 10). Inthis 
way the hypothesized correlation between periodic "pauses" in the motion of Hensen's node and the time 
of somite formation is currentlybeing studied. One can imagine numerous such situations in which the 
ability to copy geometry from one section of the film to another is of considerable value. Sketches, 
although static in themselves, canusefully be entered dynamically. A later stagein the slime mold life 
cycle involves the crawlingmotion of a worm-like aggregate of cells called a slug. The slug secretes 
a sheath on which itmoves and one would expect that the slug tends tofollow the path laid down by its 
anterior end, as a train follows the engine on a track. To test this idea one can use the Sketch facility 
with thefilm running to draw the path followed by theposterior end of the slug, then review the film 
with the Sketch overlaid to see the extent to which the anterior end stays on the path (Fig. 11).  
A quick analysis of some existing films showed that most of the body of the slug stays on thepath, but 
the front portion is somewhat freer to move around. Further study has shown that infact the front end 
lifts off the surface as it moves, a possibility we had previously overlooked,This example highlights 
the extent to which the system is often used as an exploratory, idea­ generating device in addition to 
its use in gathering numeric data. VI. ADDITIONAL FEATURES A number of additional features available 
in GALATEA are summarized briefly, on the assumptionthat the reader can imagine their uses and howthey 
would be used via the style of interaction 57 already described. The various Detailed Setup control boards 
allow soecific control of intensity, labelling, erasure, AL copying, time-shifting, etc.; of single-instances 
or groups of instances. All the examples pre-sented here have used the default values of these many options, 
e.g., Moving Points appear with the default display variant, a small square: q . Through Detailed Setup 
the user might choose a different display variant (e.g., + or . or some alphanumeric character), choose 
an alternate in-tensity for some set of instances, etc. Choice of alternative cursor display variants 
is another option. For example, when pointing to somites (as discussed in Section V) the user might prefer 
a dot as a cursor, in place of the default open cross-hair shape. Or when following cells, some users 
prefer a box cursor inside which they try to center the cell. The system also provides additional features 
for controlling the projector. Tabs and Margins, analaeous to those on a tynemer. can be set with time 
picks and invoked to move the film to points of special interest or maintain an analy-sis within a given 
range of frames. Furthermore, Loops can be defined in which the projector will run reueatedlv: this allows 
crucial data entries in subtle portions of the film-to be rehearsed and retried conveniently, e.g., indicating 
the moment and point of intersection of two rapidly moving waves. It is important to note that such waves 
usually can't be seen at low frame rates, so that data must be entered at speed, with ac-curacy achieved 
by reviewing and retrying, rather than by slowing down the entry process. The ex-istence of such phenomena 
was a primary moti-vation behind the idea of GALATEA itself. Some additional features are provided to 
aid the user in the initial space-time alignment of the projector. These include the establishment of 
the zero frame, relative to which all data is entered, resynchronization of the system to any frame number, 
and entry and automatic redisplay of fiducial marks in a special frame to faci-litate spatial alignment. 
The system also permits control over some as-pects of pen handling. Variable scaling, trans- lation, 
and clipping of the pen input area' are provided to accommodate various user choices of the film image 
size and format, as well as com-pensate for registration errors. Variable de-grees of smoothing on the 
pen data stream are available to help stabilize pen motion and re-duce jitter. Utility routines are provided 
through which the user can extract all or part of the kinegram for further analysis by his own programs. 
Typically these are small BASIC or FORTRAN programs which run on our own machine, but the MiSSIcampus 
com-puter network [l] allows us to transfer data to programs run on the University of Chicago Compu-tation 
Center's IBM 370. Further utilities allow th.e user to insert data back into the system for display and 
manipulation within GALATEA. In this way data generated by a simulation can be displayed and analyzed 
for global qualitative pro-perties. Likewise various time-shifts, averagings, enhancements, etc., of 
data gathered in GALATEA can be accomplished. In such an interactive set-ting these utilities essentially 
make BASIC, FORTRAN, the Editor, file manipulators, 2-and 3-D plot packages, etc., readily available 
adjuncts to the system. A final feature of considerable practical import- ance is that the system maintains 
a well-defined, frequently updated copy of system status in addi- tion to all data on the GALATEA disk. 
This pro- vides the basis for a "warm start" capability so that at any time a user can stop, remove his 
pack, come back tomorrow, and start where he left off. An important variant of this is where for hard- 
ware (or, dare we say, other) reasons the system crashes; the user merely picks up essentially where 
he was, losing no more than the last few frames of data entry. VII. CONCLUSION We have described a minicomputer-based 
animated graphics system that represents advances in sev- eral areas, both practical and computer scientific. 
In the area of film analysis, a significant ad- vance has been made, in our case increasing the efficiency 
with which usuable data may be gener- ated by one or two orders of magnitude. Further, the system is 
highly practical, as it has been learned and used with success by our laboratory's non-computer-oriented 
personnel. In addition to being reliable, operation has been generally cost- effective, particularly 
inasmuch as the machine has also absorbed much of the processing previous- ly obtained from our computing 
center. We believe GALATEA represents an advance in sev-eral aspects of computer graphics. Certainly 
it is another example of a successful application and synthesis of the existing state-of-the-art. Fur-ther, 
the nature of our application has been par-ticularly substantive in motivating the develop-ment of interactive 
input tools along with the no-tion of graphical data type. Our control board techniques have been quite 
successful in providing digitizing stylus oriented interactive control [9]. Additionally, some of the 
system's information handling mechanisms are of interest in animated graphics, including time and space 
kinegram slippage [4], a two-level memory and real-time paging design, and several compiling techniques 
for achieving greater efficiency [7]. Finally, the system is of interest in the area of dedicated real-time 
operating systems design. The internal architecture of the system consists of a task-oriented event-driven 
processing mechanism r71. Together with the appropriate control struc-tures, this design provides a powerful 
and yet natural framework in which to implement a system based as it is on concurrent processors and 
real-time processing. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Bob Ashenhurst, Bob Futrelle and Anthony

19174 ABSTRACT There is a need for a simple mechanized way to  design, update and produce final copies 
of scores of Labanotation, a symbolic, graphical language for the recording of body movement used by 
choreogra­ phers, anthropologists,psychologistsand thera­ pists. This paper discusses the design and 
imple­ mentation of a machine-independentdata structure for Labanotation and its application in an inter­ 
active storage, retrieval and editing system. 1. Introduction This paper describes the design of a 
machine­ independent data structure for the creation and modification of Labanotationscores and its 
imple­ mentation in an interactive graphic editor, LABA. Labanotationis a two-dimensionalgraphic language 
 for recording human body movement. While film and videotape provide the simplest means of recording 
 motion, notation allows one to discern the movement of component body parts in relation to one another 
 and in relation to their environmentwith much greater precision. Labanotation is the most exten­ sive 
recording language for motion in use today [3] because of its comparative simplicity, legibil­ity, comprehensibilityand 
applicabilityin describ­ ing complicated movements. Cartoon character illus­trations and their corresponding 
Labanotation script are depicted in figure 1. The Dance Notation Bureau records and maintains  an extensive 
library of choreographic scores in Labanotation. Producing final copies of these scores is currently 
one of the most time-consumingand la­borious tasks at the Bureau. Scores are either inked by hand or 
printed by a specially-designedIBM Selec­ tric type-element [9]. Altering a score is a major chore, for 
it usually means redrawing an entire page or more. Current demands have precipitated the need for a 
simple, mechanized way to design, update and produce final copies of notated scores. Such a graphics-orientedtext-editingsystem 
with the re­quired functional capabilities and easy-to-use command, data entry and data editing languages 
has been developed (see figure 2).  2. System structure 2.1. Hardware design This system is implemented 
on a UNIVAC 70/46 computerwith a Tektronix 4010 Storage Tube Display. Currently, input to the system 
is via the keyboard; the only output available is the screen's soft copy, but plans are being made to 
add a tablet and hard­copy unit. The capabilitiesof the display terminal limit it it to being strictly 
an input/output device. Usage of the graphics display is handled through Tektronix-suppliedFORTRAN subroutines. 
The host computer does all the processing: it sequences and controls programexecution, creates and controls 
the manipulationof the data structures, stores and re­ trieves files and records from auxiliary storage, 
requests input from the terminal, and sends output to the display processor. * Currently a DevelopmentEngineer 
with Hewlett-PackardData Terminals Division, 11000 Wolfe Rd., Cupertino, CA 95014.  2.2. Software design 
 2.2.1. Internal system design and functional capabilities The LABA system can be logically broken down 
into three component parts: file management,page management and library management. The file manage­ment 
routinesare primarily machine-dependent and handle the storage, retrieval and maintenance of user-defined 
files which will generally contain entire dance scores. The purpose of the page man­agement routines 
is threefold: sending and receiving graphical information to and from the terminal dis­play, creatingand 
maintaininga machine-independent data structure which represents a single page of a dance score, and 
retrieving and storing these data structures as logical records on secondary storage. The library routines 
handle the storage, retrieval and maintenanceof frequently-used passages as li­brary entries on secondary 
storage. Each of these component parts can be further subdivided into logi­cal units. Below is a pictorial 
representationof the system design accompanied by brief functional descriptionsof each individual task. 
 File Management A file is the basic unit which will be processed by a single editing; it will consist 
of one recorded dance score. Files are organized by the system into a variable number of fixed-length 
blocks of storage. Each block, or record, corres­ponds to a single printed page of the dance score. LABA 
is a page-orientededitor. Because only one page at a time is edited in an in-core "workspace," the user-defined 
input file is organized sequentially. After a workspace has been edited, it is written se­quentiallyonto 
a separate output file; the next page is then accessed from the original file. Once editing is completed, 
the temporary output file is named, cat­alogued and stored. One can easily overwrite an existing file 
or create a new one. Because of sequen­tial organization,backing up to a previous page is not permitted. 
 CLEAR closes any defined input and output files and erases the contents of the active workspace. CREATE 
closes any previously defined input and output files, clears the active work­space, defines a new output 
file and trans­fers control to the page generation routines. GET <filename> opens a user-specifiedfile 
as an input file. If an output file doesn't already exist, one is created. If an output file does exist, 
it is kept so that the newly opened file can be concatenatedonto the con­tents of the old one. PUT <filename> 
closes the output file and names, catalogues and permanently stores it. This routine gives the user the 
option of closing the output file as is, or, if records should still exist in an input file, transfer­ring 
the balance of the records in the input file to the output file before closing. DELETE <filename> removes 
a file from disk storage. LIST lists the names of all files stored on disk. PRINT aids the user in 
getting a hard-copy of all records stored in a defined input file. Each page in the input file is sequentially 
transferred to the active workspace and dis­played in final-draft form on the screen. After each page 
is displayed, the user may activate the hard-copy unit. The page is then placed in the output file, and 
the next page can be retrieved by typing N (NEXT). Printing may be terminated by typing E (ESCAPE). The 
user thus has the facilityof printing a selected subset of the file pages.  Page Management CREATE 
clears the active workspace, initial­izes the data structure and invokes the page generation routines. 
 RESUME permits the user to resume drawing characters on the page currently defined in the active workspace. 
 GET gets the next page from the defined a menu, and a cursor is again used to point to char­input file 
and puts it in the active acters or regions on the screen which are to be workspace.  edited. PUT 
stores the page currently defined in the active workspace as the next entry of the defined output file. 
 DELETE erases the page in the active workspace. INSERT <n> transfers the next n pages of the input 
file to the output file and invokes those routines which define a new page in the active workspace. If 
there are less than n pages in the input file, all the records are transferredto the output file and 
a new page is insertedat the end. PRINT redraws the page currently defined in the active workspace in 
final-draft form, after which the user may activate the hard­copy unit. EDIT redraws the current page 
along with a special menu listing all page modification routines. LIBRARY MGMT allows the user to access 
library entries from page management mode.  Library Management LIST lists the names of all library 
entries. GET <libname><startinglocation> copies a library entry, starting at a beat location which the 
user points to on the screen. The library sequence is copied into as many beats as are needed, as long 
as they are on the same page. If the pattern extends be­yond the available number of spaces, only that 
portion which fits is copied. If the regions which are to contain the catalogued sequence already have 
items defined in them, the old patterns are replaced by the new. PUT <libname><start_position><end_position> 
creates a library entry delimited by begin­ ning and ending beats on the staves where the pattern has 
been drawn. A library entry can contain from one beat to one page of information. DELETE <libname> 
removes a library entry.  2.2.2. External input/outputbehavior Input to the system is done by typing 
keywords  and making menu selections. There are three types of input to the LABA system: system commands, 
data entry and editing. Via system commands the user can define which of the three system modes he wishes 
and can invoke the appropriate tasks within that mode. Data entry is performed during page generation. 
Individual characters are entered into the data structure with descriptiveparameters for orienta­tion, 
color and size. Parameters are selected from a menu; the user then positions a cursor to a loca­tion 
on the display screen where a character is to be drawn and types a keyboard entry to select the character. 
Editing commands are also selectedfrom System output is predominantlypictorial. An example of a machine-drawnversion 
is shown in figure 4. It was obtained directly from a Tektronix terminalusing a hard-copy unit.  3. 
Data structures 3.1. External representation Labanotationutilizes special-purposesymbols, staves and 
floorplans to record movement. Staves are drawn vertically and are read bottom to top. A staff may be 
divided into measures and beats, as is a musical staff, to indicate timing. Symbols on the staff are 
arranged in columns, each of which repre­ sents a body part. Most symbols are directional and, when 
placed in a given beat and column region, are interpretedas the direction,or position,of the corresponding 
body part, relative to the individual, for a given duration of time. Additional adverbial symbols and 
the size, orientation and coloration of the action symbols describe the degree, or manner,of the body 
change. Floorplans lend a third dimension to the notation. They are rectangularareas analo­ gous to 
the overhead depiction of a room or stage; the placement of performer symbols and arrows on the floorplan 
depict the positions and paths of movement of the dancers relative to the stage and to one another. 
A page of Labanotation is composed of symbols placed on an arbitrary number of staves and floor­plans. 
The remaining space on a page is sometimes used to convey additional information to the reader or the 
dancer. A score is nothingmore than a collec­tion of pages; a score contains the movements of all body 
parts of all individuals associated with a given dance or activity. 3.2. Internal representation When 
translating from an externalpicture struc­ture to an internal data structure, the physical page layout 
must first be decomposed into a set of logical units which are somehow related. This logical page organization 
is then translated into a simple, manip­uable storage structure. 3.2.1. Logical design Labanotationscores 
have a hierarchical organi­zation. A score is a sequence of pages, and each page contains some combination 
of floorplans and staves. The LABA system permits the user to store at most four staves on any given 
page. Each staff­area contains a staff-region,an area above the staff-region (TOP), an optional starting-position 
area below the staff-region (STARTPOSITION)and an area beneath that (BOTTOM). As the user may request 
fewer staves than there are staff-areas, the LABA system distinguishes be­tween those staff-regionswhich 
contain user-defined staves (ABSOLUTESTAVES)and those regions which do not (VIRTUALSTAVES). Absolute 
staves are composed of a set of adjacent columns and are subdivided into measures and beats. Objects, 
which are defined to be the character primitives of the LABA system and their descriptive parameters, 
can be placed anywhereon the page; LABA distinguishesbetween the placement of objects in regions (suchas 
TOP, BOTTOM, FLOORPLAN, and VIRTUALSTAFF)and in absolute staves and start­ing-positionboxes (wherethe 
staff becomes secondary to the beat-columnregion in which the object is stored). The logical data structure 
is simply a tree (see figure 5). The root is a score, the nodes represent pictures (pages) and sub-pictures 
(floorplans, staves, regions, etc.), and the leaves are the system's char­acter primitives and their 
descriptive indicators. The realization of this logical organization dictates the internal storage structure. 
 3.2.2. Physical design The data being manipulated can be thought of in terms of a hierarchy of levels. 
At the top-most level there is the physical storage device, which consistsof one or more files. The file 
consists of a sequentiallyordered sequence of printed pages. A page can essentially be defined as a 
set of regions (as described in the preceding section) and a collectionof objects which appear in the 
regions. As the types of regions and the maximumnumber of allowable regions of a given type are fixed 
by the system, the data structure for each page must con­tain a descriptionof the page layout which enumer­ates 
the types and amount of regions which exist on that page. The objects which appear on a page can all 
be encoded in a linear list, and all objects which appear in the same region can be associated by being 
chained together in a linked list structure. Any defined region which containsobjects has a pointer to 
the head of an object list. Figure 6 gives a pictorial representationof the physical data structure. 
  4. Evaluation This system will shortly be available for use at the Dance Notation Bureau. Only after 
extensive use by professionals in the field can one evaluate a system for its simplicity and practicality. 
It is safe to say, however, that the myth concerning the sacrosanctityof the final copy has been destroy­ed. 
The ease with which revisions and hard copies can be made will clearly revolutionize the discipline of 
notating. According to estimates by the Dance Notation Bureau [5], the system promises a four-fold speed-up 
of the creation of dance scores as well as an increase in accuracy and reductionof cost. At present,a 
score done by hand costs between $1000 and $3000 for a full-lengthhalf-hour ballet. Rough notes taken 
by the notator during dance rehearsals must first be transcribed into a carefully penciled docu­ment 
and finally into a pen-and-ink drawing. Produc­ing the final copy can take up to 100 person-hours. Changes 
after the final inking are laborious. Presently, the Bureau also verifies each completed score with 
another certified notator; this, too, is a long, drawn-out process. While it is currently difficult 
to estimate how much a score will cost using a computer, one can safely estimate that the costs would 
be cut in half and that the scores would be available in a fraction of the time. 5. Future research 
 There are several possible extensions to the system. They are listed below in the order of their feasibility: 
 1. Extend the LABA editor so that it is capable of doing file-editing. Notators would like the ability 
to edit all sequences of a given type throughout the file. They would also like the facility of extracting 
 all floorplans within a file, inverting them, and redrawing them at the end of a score. 2. Instead 
of producing hard-copy on the Tektronix, it would be feasible to develop an interface between any display 
processor and an IBM Selectric typewriter so that the pages can be typed out using the IBM type­element 
with the special Labanotation char­ acter set. 3. Enhance the user interface to the editor by developing 
a linguistic package which accepts "natural language" input instead of graphical input. There is clearly 
a mapping from English into the graphical language. Labanotation is a clearly con­structed grammar which 
defines actions (verbs) and the body parts that perform those actions (nouns). Also, how the action is 
done, the degree of change, or the manner of performance, is described by adverbs.  4. The inverse mapping 
from graphical  language into English exists. Output could be enhanced by accompanyinga Labanotation 
score with correspondingEnglish text. 5. Develop a system which can "understand" the semantics of Labanotation 
and can re­create the body movements on a CRT screen using stick figures.  6. Examine other notational 
systems, extract those primitives necessary to de­scribe movement, and develop a generalized  data structure 
which allows the user to translate one notation into another.  7. Extract movement from consecutive 
frames  of a digitized film [1] and construct the notation.  BIBLIOGRAPHY [1] Badler,Norman I., Temporal

 A SUMMARY OF GRAPHICS TERMINAL REQUIREMENTS BASED ON APPLICATION STUDIES Eric D. Carlson IBM Research 
Laboratory San Jose, CA 95193 Decreasing costs of graphics hardware, improvements in graphics software,

terms of the requirements indicates that eighteen of the thirty requirements are provided inadequately.Comparison 
of the relative importance of the requirements for different classes of applicationsindicates that color,

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania THE HRD-1LASER DISPLAY SYSTEM P. A. Woodsford Laser-Scan LaboratoriesLtd., 
 Cambridge, ENGLAND The Laser-Scan HRD-1 is both a large screen, high resolution interactive storage 
display and a high quality precision film plotter. It is therefore relevant to both the interactive 
editing and the production aspects of computer graphics systems, and its characteristicsare particularly 
suited to application areas such as automated cartogra­ phy, in which large amounts of graphical data 
 have to be displayed and manipulated. 1. PRINCIPLES AND CHARACTERISTICS.  The heart of the HRD-1 is 
its computer-controlled laser beam deflection system, which combines speed and flexibility with high 
definition and reproduci­bility. Drawing speed is such that a typical 1 : 1250 map of central London 
or, for instance, a com­plex A0 architectural plan can be plotted at X10 reduction on fiche size film 
(148 mm x 105 mm) in about a minute. Alternativelythese can be dis­played, rather more quickly, on the 
1.0m x 0.70m screen of the system. The drawing speed on this screen is 5m/sec. The reproducabilityand 
accu­racy of the HRD-1are derived from the use of interferometriccontrol techniques, the laser de­flection 
system being random access and oriented towards line drawing. Because of its high speed the machine 
can, of course, be programmed for shading and area filling applications. Effectively continuous control 
of the laser's intensity makes possible the production of grey scale shaded pictures. The flexibilityof 
the deflection system ensures that drawing time is substantially insensitive to the complexity of the 
 drawing, well formed characters and other fine detail being produced at much the same speed as uniform 
straight lines. The basic optical layout of the system is shown in fig. 1. The light source is a CW 
Argon Ion laser. The light modulator serves to maintain a line drawing intensity independent of velocity 
profile, the actual intensity level being programmable as a 10 bit quantitywith absolute and incremental 
con­ trol. The dynamic focus lens serves to focus the writing beam in the film plane, independentlyof 
 the position addressed. The proprietary X-Y de­ flectors position the beam with linear rate con­ trol. 
The deflectors are based on those used in Sweepnik, an ancestor of the HRD-1 originating from the Cavendish 
Laboratory,Cambridge and used for automatic measuring of bubble chamber film (1). These deflectors 
are based on interferometric control, with an angular unit of approximatelyone microradian. Two film 
planes are selectable by switching the position of a mirror. These two positions give rise to the display 
mode and the hard copy mode, the former involving projection at X10 magnificationonto the HRD-1 screen. 
  FIG. 1. HRD-1 OPTICAL LAYOUT. In addition, in the display mode, a separate opti­cal path gives rise 
to a refresh mode, superim­posed on the stored (projected) image on the screen Use of laser light and 
simple, diffraction limited optics results in a spot size well below 20 microns. For film plotting on 
an area of 148mm x 105mm., resolution is therefore in excess of 7000 x 5000 lines. For display purposes 
a smaller area is used, giving 5000 x 3500 resolvable lines on the screen. Addressability is to within 
one tenth of a line width. The HRD-1 is controlled by a minicomputer, inter­face's to the DEC PDP 11 
and EDP 15 being currently available. The interface, which is based on 16 bit word transfers, is parallel, 
asynchronous and inter­rupt-driven. Basic software, in the form of FOR-TRAN callable subroutine libraries, 
has been developed to make all the facilities of the HRD-1 available to the applications programmer. 
The philosophy is based on that of the long-established GINO graphics software package (2) , without, 
at present, the 3D emphasis. The basic software is developed most fully on the PDP 11/45 computer. 2. 
DISPLAY USE AND INTERACTION Fig. 2. shows a picture of the display. The cabi­net behind the console is 
the optics unit, which contains the laser, deflection system and film wri- FIG. 2. THE RD-1 CONSOLE 
(1.0 m x 0.70 m SCREEN). The (1.0m x 0.7m) display screen of the HRD-1 can be viewed under normal lighting 
conditions, the image appearing as dark lines on an orange/yellow background. This is obtained by writing 
with the laser on a photochromic film (3) of this colour, which is projected onto the screen.A reel of 
this film on a computer-controlled film transport is used so that the screen can be cleared at any time 
by advancing to new film. Image retention time on the screen is around twenty minutes, during which the 
image fades slowly Outside the projection system, fading (which is a thermal effect) is much slower. 
Once clear, the film may be reused so, in practice, a given reel of photochromic film is cycled a large 
number of times The key to the interactive capabilities of the HRD-1 is its refresh mode. This permits 
non stored information to be superimposed on the screen. Re­ fresh information appears in blue. Refresh 
mode resolution is somewhat lower (around one quarter) than that of the stored picture. Lines and charac­ 
ters equivalent to a screen diagonal can be dis­ played, repetition rate being the only limitation. A 
cursor, steered by a tracker ball, is available and completely general refresh patterns can be programmed. 
Refresh mode may therefore be used as feedback when graphical items are selected ("picked") with the 
cursor, trial positions of items (eg. special symbols) are considered, or operator messages are displayed. 
A set of 16 function buttons and an alphanumeric keyboard are also provided. Graphical edits are indicated 
on the storedimage, a suitablv updated version being re-drawn on clear film as reauired. A useful tech­niaue 
is to subdivide the screen, so that immediate history is still viewable. 3. FILM HARDCOPY. The HRD-1 
also contains a station for writing on to fiche sized diazo film. This film is daylight handable and 
is developed by a simple desk-top machine, providing permanent hardcopy with clear lines on a dark background, 
ideal for reproduction. High quality, "full scale" masters can he produced by photographic enlargement 
(an A@' drawing is pro­ duced with X10 magnification). Provided an in­variant reprographic process is 
used, output on the fiche (which in this case services as an interme­diate master) can be calibrated 
so that the resul­ting "full scale" master is accurate to within a fraction of the line width. The correction 
invol­ved is non-linear, resulting from distortions in the recording process (eg. those arising from 
wri­ting on a flat plane in terms of angular displace­ments) and in the reprographic process, but it 
can be adequately represented by cubic polynomials. Alternatively, paper hardcopy suitable for edit purposes 
can be obtained from the fiche using sim­ple viewer printers. For this purpose (and for all but the most 
accurate1 simple linear correction suffices. Hardcopy from the HRD-1 is suitable for use in pro­ duction 
drafting systems such as may be found in engineering and architecture. In this connection, the display 
feature provides a valuable "quick look" facility. Some of the special features of the HRD-1 are particularly 
suited to cartography. Characters can be generated in all point sizes, styles are available in hardware 
and lines of any weight can be generated by the computer. 4. INTERACTIVE EDITING. The HRD-1 provides 
an interactive graphics facility with the information handling capacity and size of a drawing board. 
 69 It makes possible interaction with large quantities of graphical data, without having to make exces­ 
sive use of windowing techniques. Applications in which large quantities of graphical data al­ ready 
exist in forms suitable for computer manip­ ulation are particularly suitable. Examples in­ clude automated 
cartography, and the creation of large engineering and architectural drawings using libraries of standard 
components, and the verifi­ cation, modification and completion of the output of routeing algorithms 
in network applications. Also, the high-resolutionand large screen area of the HRD-1makes it suitable 
for the design and appraisal of smooth curves and three dimen­ sional surfaces. A storage display avoids 
the necessity of holding large amounts of information in fast core. Not only is this expensive in terms 
of hardware, but may well make excessive demands on a refresh system due to repetition rates. The ability 
to combine a complex picture held in stored mode with superimposed dynamic information offers many ad­vantages. 
 To select items for deletion or modification a cursor symbol is used. This is positioned on the screen 
by the operator using a tracker ball. Since association is by proximity, a confirmatory stage is used 
to avoid possible ambiguities. The item closest to the cursor symbol is highlighted in refresh (blue), 
informing the operator of the computer's interpretationof his intentions. This interpretationcan be 
confirmed or rejected by use of the appropriate function button. If rejected, the next closest item 
is selected. In this way any item can be selected very rapidly, and the operator can be sure that no 
error or ambiguity has occurred. The actual deletionor modification of items is achieved by making 
appropriate changes in the data structure. Changes to the displayed pic­ ture are made by "scrubbing" 
items, or parts of items, that have to be removed and drawing in the new information. Changes to the 
data structure are made to a temporary copy, which can be dumped as a permanent file at any stage. 
 Back-up to defined earlier stages is thus pro­ vided. Editing of a large graphical data set (eg. a 
map) thus proceeds by a sequence of operations, in­ volving item selection and editing commands.  The 
simple and most common of these commands are issued by the use of function buttons. Exam­ ples of these 
would be item deletion, insertion of line elements or translation of item. More complex commands such 
as that required to an­ notate with a specific type size and at an angle, providing at the same time, 
the label information,involvethe use of an alphanumeric keyboard. At any time an updated version of 
the graphical dataset may be requested. The screen is cleared and the new version drawn, in the case 
of a com­ plex picture, in one to two minutes. Alternative­ ly, only a portion of the screen need be 
redrawn in a few seconds, if the area of interest can be identified. The HRD-1 is thus admirably suited 
to the inter­active modification of large and complex graphical datasets. This is particularlythe case 
if the changes that have to be made are in the nature of detailed "tidying up" rather than complete geo­metric 
reconfigurations. This is the case in automated cartography,where the bulk of raw data is available in 
nearly correct form, or where digital maps have to be updated. The large screen and visual quality of 
the HRD-1 ensure that fea­tures can be selected for modification from a dis­play of the whole map, or 
from a portion of the whole, where relevant.  5. CARTOGRAPHIC SOFTWARE. Applications programs for 
use with cartographic data have been developed for use with the HRD-1. The data is assumed to consist 
of items which may be point strings, character strings, circular arcs or symbol (macro)references. Point 
strings may be joined by linear interpolation (line strings) or by high order interpolation (curves). 
Typi­cally, third order interpolation is used. Within the internal data structure provision is made for 
each item to have associated with it both graphi­ cal and non-graphical information. Both types of information 
can be inspected and modified at the HRD-1 screen. Graphical information is qualifying information determining 
how the feature is ren­dered (eg. line style, line weight, character size, character font). Non-graphical 
information is typically a feature code, categorising the item in some cartographic sense. Provision 
is made for displaying and manipulating subsets of the data defined by particular selections of fea­ture 
codes ("layering"). The internal data structure used assumes that the order of items is immaterial, 
in that it reorders items for the convenienceof its search algorithms This reordering is performed when 
a new dataset is first encountered; at the same time translation from the external user format takes 
place. A wide range of editing commands is provided in­cluding:­ (i) delete item or part of item (ii) 
create new item (iii) extend existing item (iv) change position of item (v) join items (vi) copy item 
 A set of constraints can be invoked when creating new items or extending existing items. Typical of 
these aids to construction are:­ (i) parallelism/perpendicularity  (ii) interpolate fractional point 
  (iii) building squaring (iv) fillet (join linear items with an arc). A typical case of cartographic 
editing is illus­ trated in figs. 3. and 4. which demonstrate some of the changes that can be made using 
the HRD-1 screen.  In particular, the dataset under consideration is the union of two datasets which 
are imperfectly matched across their common (geometrical) boundary. Editing commands are used to make 
good the imper­ fections. This operation is termed "edge-panel­ ling". A related operation is that of 
"edge-match­ ing" where two datasets are made consistent across an edge without losing their individual 
identities. Three forms of symbols (macros) are dealt with. Instances of one point symbols are always 
geo­metrically similar. They are specified by ref­erence number and one or two pairs of locating coordinates. 
A mechanism is provided for defin­ ing and modifying libraries of symbol definitions, external to the 
editing operation. The final type of symbol, termed function symbols, require com­putation for each instance. 
These are implemented by program subroutines. Considerable attention has been paid to data se­ curity 
and back-up. The currentdata can be dum­ped at any stage by the operator to provide back­up stages. Deletion 
or change of any item only becomes irrevocable at the next redraw operation. Until this time deleted 
items exist in a "limbo" state from which they can be recalled by the op­erator. Development of the 
HRD-1began in 1971, with co­operation between Laser-Scan and the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory. 
The first HRD-1 was installed there late in 1973, for use in com­puter aided design. Of the systems now 
in the field, a significant proportion are used in auto­mated cartography. Ongoing hardware and software 
development is concerned with integrating data capture and interactive editing. Acknowledgements The

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ARCHITECTURE-BY-YOU RSELF An Experiment with Computer Graphics 
for House Design' Guy Weinzapfel and Nicholas Negroponte Architecture Machine Group, Department of Architecture 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts Architecture-by-Yourself is an experiment 
in computer aided design that applies the medium of computer graphics, used by a generalpopulace. The 
research program confronts the delicate balance between insightfulness and paternalism toward a user 
who ultimatelybares the risk. The paper reports on a case study, on the underlying philosophy's of the 
French architect Yona Friedman, and on a computer implementation called YONA. As part of a larger research 
effort, Machine Recognition and Inference Making in ComputerAids to Design, we postulate further developments 
that will exercise input and visualization techniques in a relentless setting, relentless in the sense 
that the user is demanding, the problem is hard, and the product is a personal, one-of-a-kind design. 
1. INTRODUCTION design "actions," participating only to provide graphic representations where they were 
needed and to suggest "next steps" when the Architecture-by-yourself is an ongoing applications work 
unit of a couple's efforts were frustrated. computer graphics research project titled, "Machine Recognition 
and Inference Making in Computer Aids to Design" [1]. As its title sug­ gests, Architecture-by-yourself 
is concerned with the development of design aids for "do-it-yourself" designers -people designing their 
own homes or apartments. We see these users as designers, but designers who, unlike architects, are not 
trained or practiced in the skill. For this reason, their requirements for design aids differ significantly 
from those of aids created for architects. Most importantly, unpracticed designers require much greater 
assistance in visualizing their goals and potential form solutions for those goals. They also require 
assistance (not paternalism) in the process of design -direction, if you will, as to how to go about 
designing, what steps to pursue next, what to do when progress has stopped. Also, we can argue that they, 
unlike architects, bear a risk! It is these demands-to visualization and for strategic assistance­ which 
make design aids for unpracticed designers especially appealing to the Architecture Machine Group, for 
the Group's major interest is "to understand the makings of architecture; the interfaces between people, 
machines, and the real world" [2]. It is our expectation that the demands of the unpracticed will push 
forward developments in the other components of our research program. Focusing on appli­cations for the 
"by-yourself designer" will accelerate development of graphical input techniques, display capabilities 
and design strategy systems. The goal of Architecture-by-Yourself is to allow people to design their 
own homes without either a middleman or a middle machine creating whole solutions for them. This goal 
diverges from other ef­ forts in computer-assisted architecture which either have generatedcomplete designs 
for the "user" (such as the ARCHIT system devel­oped at the University of Oregon [3] ) or have required 
of him a skill and an experience completely at odds with a novice's role (IMAGE would be an example of 
such a system [4]). 2. DESIGN CASE STUDY To test our hypothesis about the needs of unskilled designers, 
and to get a sense of the difficulty of what we hoped to do, a simplefirst step was undertaken: a case 
study of a young couple design­ing their own home, a home which they would actually build and live in. 
This experiment was naively constructed, yet produced very instructive results. The couple met each week 
for 8 weeks with the Architecture­by-Yourself staff. The staff did not function in a conventional archi­tectural 
fashion. Rather, they served as observers of the couple's   74 Additionally, the couple was never able 
to visualize what proposed de­signs would look like. This proved to be a difficult task for the ob­servers 
as well. Perspectives, showing how a building or space might appear, are time consuming and difficult 
to draw -sufficiently diffi­cult so that the staff seldom had enough time to provide a represent­ation 
which was adequate for the couple to make decisions. Conclusions from the case study verified our hypothesis: 
any design aid developed for unpracticed designers would have to be based on a methodology which incorporated 
a clear, step-by-step strategy. This was needed to serve as a basis for directing users when they were 
halted.  3. YONA FRIEDMAN'S GRAPH THEORY PROCESS The design method proposed by Yona Friedman in his 
book Towards a Scientific Architecture [6] provided just such a framework. His notion is that the linkages 
of the house -the connections (doorways)between its spaces -provide both the backbone of the design and 
the largest payoff in terms of describing the designer's objectives. Friedman represents the rooms of 
the house and the linkages between them as a graph':  The graph enables the designer to see simple difficulties 
in his link­ages. The use of a graph representation also permits an observer to monitor the designer's 
progress and to use graph theory to spot troubles early on. These "troubles" might include: 1. the need 
for multilevels 2. enclosed spaces (implying size and window limitations) 3. impossible access between 
groups of spaces.  Yona Friedman's approach also proposes a series of functions or steps which form 
a procedural strategy for the inexperienced designer to follow. By determining first a graph, then bubbles 
over the graph,then shapes over the bubbles, this approach introduces completeness to the design without 
undue complexity. After the user has learned to deal with one component of design with confidence, the 
next con­cept is brought forth. The problem is elaborated until the user is able to deal with an assemblage 
of concepts and to cycle among them. The strategy is sufficiently flexible so that a user can jump about 
on his own initiative if he wishes. Perhaps most importantly, Friedman's approach decomposes the de­sign 
problem, not by abstract concepts of form and function, or by service spaces and areas served, but by 
the more tangible factors of room placement, connectivity, size, shape, and 3D form. The graph theory 
approach is additionally pleasing inasmuch as it incorporates the notion of using different representations, 
each of which is uniquely appropriate to a specific function: 1. planar graphs for room placement relative 
to other rooms, to sun, wind, and view 2. "bubble diagrams" to visualize areas 3. plan diagrams to 
determine room shape  4. THE YONA SYSTEM The happy correspondence between (1) our interests in graphic 
com­munications and nonpaternalistic guidance, (2) the conclusions derived from our case study, and (3) 
the capabilities of the graph theory approach led quite naturally to the implementation of this approach 
on the Architecture Machine Group's min-computers. This implementation, titled YONA, runs on any of the 
Group's Interdata machines (these enclude a Model 70, 7/32s and an 85). Each machine has 64K bytes of 
core, and any differences between models is transparent to the implementation. User/machine communication 
is entirely graphical, using IMLAC dynamic displays. Until recently, a light pen had been used for input, 
but this device proved to be cumbersome and inaccurate. A Touch Sensitive Display tablet [7] has been 
fitted in place of the IMLAC's implosion shield so that users can manipulate objects on the screen by 
pointing at them with their fingers.. This eliminates one of the more serious barriers between naive 
users and the machine. It is illustrated at the top of the next page.  75  All of YONA's routines 
are written in PL/1, the support for which was developed by the Group s software support staff. The size 
of the system is sufficiently large so that an overlay is used for each of the system s six major functions. 
Programs within each overlay are organized so that any action taken by a user will receive immediate 
foreground attention, while periods of user inactivity permit the system to analyze consequences of the 
user s actions in a back­ground mode.  4.1. MAKE SPACES. In this first of the system s six functions, 
the user identifies which spaces he wishes to include in his home. He does this by pointing at candidate 
space names in a menu beside the display window. He may also type the names of those spaces which he 
does not find in the menu. Created spaces are displayed and an indication of area is in­cluded adjacent 
to the name in the form of a bar spanning from very small to very large. A pointer is located on the 
bar, set initially to the center (average) location, and a numerical value for that pointer location 
is printed at the end of the line. The user can adjust the size of a space by pointing at the area arrow 
and sliding it to a new position. While he does this, the numerical value is updated in real time. When 
the arrow is released, background rou­tines total the present areas and print the sum along with a range 
of probable construction costs at the bottom of the screen. In this way, the user is kept abreast of 
the cost consequences of each change in his specification. By manipulating areas relative to cost estimates, 
the user can deal with his trade-offs immediately, avoiding unnecessary disappointments later in the 
process. This simple feature has proven to be one of the most useful in the system, and one which is 
entirely out of the question in a conventional process. When the user has created all the spaces he wants, 
he goes on to the next step simply by pointing at LINK SPACES in the upper menu. The screen is blanked 
and a message appears, PLEASE WAIT. OVERLAYING NEW ROUTINES. , until that operation is completed (approximately 
5 seconds).  4.2 LINK SPACES. Instructions at the top of the screen inform the user that spaces are 
linked by first pointing at one space, then at the space with which it is to be linked. The first space 
identified begins to blink and continues to do so until it is pointed at again. In this way, one space 
can be linked to several others in rapid succession. A redundant matrix of the linkages is displayed 
and updated as each new link is added. This has been shown to be of great value, as a user can read across 
any set of links to verify that the appropriate connection has been made. Links are deleted simply by 
pointing to the name of either of the linked spaces where it appears in the IS LINKED WITH portion of 
the window. That is, a link between kitchen and entry could be deleted by pointing either at kitchen 
where it appears to the right of entry, or entry to the right of kitchen. As each additional link is 
created, background routines, using graph theorems [8], test that the graph implied by linkages is still 
planar. Where it is not, a message is displayed at the bottom of the screen: NO SINGLE LEVEL ARRANGEMENT 
CAN BE FOUND FOR THIS SET OF LINKS. The user is then referred to a training manual which explains his 
options: 1. deleting links 2. adding circulation spaces and relinking 3. dealing with multiple levels 
in separate graphs.  It is interesting that. to date. no naive user has yet triggered this message. 
 76 4.3 ARRANGE GRAPH. An initial graph configuration of the specified "home" is generated for the 
user in which no links are shown crossing. At present, a simple, heuristic approach is used for this 
generation. However, it is known that the heuristic will not work for all cases, and a determin­istic 
technique [9] is to be implemented shortly. 4.4 MOVE SPACES. The user rearranges the graph by pointing 
at any "node" and sliding it to a new location. Crossed links provide graphic "warnings" that the connections 
involved are impossible. Background routines being developed will warn if "NO ARRANGEMENT IS POSSIBLE 
WITH-OUT SOME ENCLOSED SPACE." * Further background routines may be added to check that orien­tation 
for views, sun, and wind are maintained. Development of these routines have been postponed because we 
are concerned that soliciting the necessary information may be too taxing for users of the system. It 
may be better to ask and do less. Experiments in the next year will address this issue. 4.5 PRE-SHAPE 
SPACES. After a satisfactory arrangement is achieved, "bubbles" of the appro­priate areas are displayed 
over each node/space. The bubbles are drawn using a closed B-spline curve algorithm [10]. The splines 
are "fitted" within polygons which are formed by the dual of the graph and an outside perimeter which 
matches the boundary of the graph.  77  4.6 SKETCH SHAPE. REFERENCES  Using the sized bubbles as 
area guides, the user sketches the actual shapes of the rooms. To simplify this task, a grid is displayed 
to which the sketched lines are snapped. Only straight lines and arcs are possible at this time. As the 
shapes are completed, the bubbles are deleted. Checking for the reporting of major deviations from area 
requirements are done in the background. And our adjusted cost estimate is dis­played. (These are not 
shown in the previous figure as these rou­tines are only now being interfaced with the system.) 5. FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENT Two additional capabilities will be added during the next year. The first of these will 
translate the sketched room shapes into more com­plete plan representations, showing wall thicknesses 
and door and window locations and enabling placement of furniture. 1. Machine Recognition and Inference

and thicknesses indicated and furniture placed. YONA presently makes no use of the Machine Group s rapidly 
devel­oping raster scan capabilities. The coming year s work, however, should see significant explorations 
of this technology for visualizations of designed environments. One can easily imagine a user painting 
the walls of his/her living room, not only with various colors but with textures as well (brick, panelling, 
et cetera). In summary, we see Architecture-by-Yourself as a worst-case exercise in man-machine interaction. 
The machine must be simultaneously understanding, helpful and not paternalistic. The user must deal with 
the soul-searching decisions of personal design. And, the partnership must yield a workable, cost-affective, 
one-of-a-kind solution. 78

drafting system is an excellent example of such an environment. 1. INTRODUCTION A person is smart, 
creative and slow.... while a computer is stupid, uncreative and very fast. A continuing problem is one 
of providing an environment in which the person and machine can work together as a productive problem 
solving team. Computer Graphics provides that environ­ment....and automatic drafting is an ideal application. 
 To be successful in the commercial environment, automatic drafting systems must: .provide a comfortable, 
non­threatening environment to the draftsperson and designer. .increase the users productivity in order 
to justify the relatively high systems cost. The ability of the automatic drafting system to satisfy 
these key requirements depends in larger part on the human factors aspect of the system...hardware and 
software...design. 2. WHAT IS IN A TYPICAL AUTOMATIC DRAFTING SYSTEM A typical stand-alone automatic 
drafting system includes: .A computation facility with mini­computer and mass memory (for programs 
and drawing storage) with the drafting system software. Permission to make digital or hard copies of 
part or all of this work or personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are 
not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full 
citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, to republish, to post on servers, or to redistribute to 
lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. Siggraph 76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
.Draftsmenwork stations, which may consist of a refresh cathode ray tube, light pen, function keyboard, 
 and alphanumeric keyboard, or Digitizers combined with a storage tube, graphic tablet, function keyboard, 
and alphanumeric key­board. .A hard copy device (like a plotter or COM), or A storage medium (like magnetic 
tape), attached to the computation facility so that plotting tape can be produced and then taken to the 
hard copy device location. A system may have several kinds of mass storage (like disks, magnetic tape 
and cassettes), may support several work stations, and may have several hard copy units (like an electrostatic 
printer/ plotter, electromechanical plotter, and COM unit). In addition, the system may also be used 
for supplementary program­ming, and may therefore include a printer, card reader, and paper tape punch/reader. 
 3. USER ENVIRONMENT A typical draftsperson, using an auto­matic drafting system, is quite apprehensive 
about being "replaced by a computer". Therefore, great care must be taken that the user feels comfortable 
at the system's work station. 79 In my judgement, the station should be as "drafting-like", and as 
little as "computer-like" as possible. The user will want a reference table near-by... but will probably 
not want to be confrontedby a computer console. The draftsperson must be able to handle all the systems 
drawing functions without knowing anything about computers or programming. The tasks should all be accomplished 
expeditiously,with the system constantly prompting the operator about procedures, available functions 
and next steps. Each user must be able to communicate with the system in a natural way, by pointing 
and/or activating suitably labeled keys, for example. Typing should be kept to a minimum...basicallyto 
enter or change text, or to enter numeric dimensionsor position data, but not to enter drawing commands. 
 The system should let the user know that an instructionhas been received.... and must respond to that 
instruction within a time interval consistent with the users expectation. Fundamentally, the system 
must provide a fatigue-free, sympathetic environment to the user. 4. INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY An automatic 
drafting system sells in the range of $150,000 and up. Depending on usage, number of stations, etc., 
the cost per work station hour is in the range of $10 to $50. Based on the "loaded" rate of a typical 
draftsperson, the system must increase the productivity of the user by about 3:1, just to break even. 
 A well-designed system, used in an appropriate application,can often in­ crease productivity in the 
range of 6:1 or more. And, of course, it is this increase which accounts for the remarkable growth 
of automatic drafting systems in the last few years. To obtain this increase in productivity, an automatic 
drafting system should at least give the draftsperson all the facilities one needs to create or change 
 any kind of drawing. These typically include ability to: .convert a drawing into computer­handleable 
form. .select (by title and/or number) a drawing already stored. .store (by title and/or number) any 
drawing created or changed. .combine portions of stored drawings with new information. .select from 
a large library of pre-stored symbols (or to create new symbols as needed). .define lines, arcs, curves, 
circles, and surfaces in 2D or 3D, graphi­cally or numerically,by a variety of geometric techniques. 
 .add or change text. .automaticallyspline. .automaticallyfillet. .automaticallydimension. .automaticallysection 
(cross hatch). .manipulatea portion of a drawing by copying, scaling, deleting, moving, rotating, aligning, 
and windowing. .change several views by working on one view. .automaticallyinterchange measure­ ment 
units. .automaticallyproduce isometrics. .view only certain of classes (or levels) of data on a drawing. 
 .producehard copy in any desired form...paper,microfilm, etc....at any desired scale. Drafting supervisors 
also expect auto­ matic drafting systems to provide several intangible benefits to which it is difficult 
to assign a dollar value. .Improved drawing quality...production of inked drawings in virtually the 
same time and at the same cost as conventional pencil drawings...and the drawings have consistent quality, 
from one to the other. .Improved compliance with standards... standard parts, standard symbols, standard 
notes, standard drafting practices can be all locked into the software. Finally, the process of creating 
a draw­ing can often also create a data base, and that data base can be used to produce additional output. 
 .design analysis can be performed. .parts lists and bills of materials can be produced. .machine tool 
N/C tapes can be made. 80 There is strong evidence that these data base features can produce savings 
that potentially swamp the currently measurable savings reported for drawing production. Incidentally, 
the users of this additional output may be more computer-orientedand less intimidated if computer operator/ 
programmer-likeactions are needed to initiate these functions. 5. SUMMARY Computer Graphics provides 
the ideal environment for the drafting environment. While the draftsperson should be insulated from 
the computer, other users of the system can be asked to perform computer­ oriented tasks.

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Interactive Simulation of Network Pumping Policies on a Computer-BasedGraphics 
System P.F. Perry and J.D. Keenan Assistant Professors Department of Civil and Urban Engineering University 
of Pennsylvania ABSTRACT This paper is concerned with the development of a computer-basedgraphics system 
for interac­tive simulation of pumping policies on water sup­ply networks. The method evaluates various 
stra­tegies which are input to the computer via a light-pen graphics facility, and displays to the operator 
the cost of the input strategy based on a mathematical model of the pumping tariff which isdeveloped. 
The method has been used for policy analysis on a pressure zone of a network in the United Kingdom, and 
the calculations implemented on a Fortran-based minicomputer graphics system. 1. Introduction The field 
of computer control isgrowing ra­pidly and achieving widespread industrial recog­nition and acceptance1. 
Engineers inthe pro­cess industries and application engineers in the computer and instrumentation industries 
are being drawn into computer control projects in increasing numbers, and therefore require infor­mation 
about the concepts, equipment, and ap­plications of this new technology. Perhaps the most significant 
and profound development of this technological revolution has been the ad­vent of the high speed digital 
computer, whose vast potential lies in its character as an in­formation handling and information processing 
machine. Under man's guidance, computers can take diverse information in large quantities and transform 
itrapidly into usable form. This has made itpossible for data from complex industrial processes to be 
efficiently collec­ted and processed, and subsequently used as an aid for the optimum operation and management 
of the system. Inmany cases, the presentation of data ina more easily assimilated form has signi­ficantly 
improved manual operation of the process. Also, given an accurate dynamic model of the sys­tem and the 
ability to implement controls from the computer, the possibility arises of completely automatic optimal 
operation. The fundamental reason why industrial pro­cesses lend themselves to computer techniques is 
because of the computer's ability to handle infor­mation flow, which isthe essential ingredient of control, 
in an efficientmanner. Every process involves three kinds of flow: flow of materials, flow of energy, 
and flow of information, and be­ cause of this key role of information--whether in single-variablecontrol, 
multivariable process control, plant control or corporate control--the computer is the logical tool to 
use. Therefore, just as there have long been excellent devices de­signed to facilitatematerial handling 
and energy transmission, the modern process control computer takes its place as a device designed to 
facilitate information processing for control purposes in in­dustrial operations. Developments inmodern 
control theory and its applications are increasingly concerned with the on-line control of complex systems 
2, 3, 4. These systems may in general be represented by large non-linear dynamic models, with high control 
and state dimensionality,and stochastic disturbances which corrupt the state measurements on the sy­stem. 
It is often appropriate to use an optimal control inwhich the control inputs are calculated to minimize 
a performance index subject to the constraints imposed by the plant. This is parti­cularly true for mass 
or energy distribution sys­tems, since in such cases it is often possible to accurately specify the cost 
of operation, and thus successful implementationof an optimal control will lead to operation of the system 
at minimum cost. The technical problems in implementing such a control are several. Considerablymore 
varia­bles have to be measured and made available cen­trally than inmore conventional non-optimal con­trol 
schemes, and thus a powerful centralized computer for data collection and system control is essential. 
Since optimization implies the mini­mization of a performance index over a period of time, e.g., one 
day's or a week's operation, it isnecessary to predict the behaviour of some va­riables over that time 
period.5 The computer al­gorithms used for optimization and other calcula­tions must be economical to 
run, capable of dea­ling with systems of high dimensionality,and com­putationally robust--in particular, 
they must be relatively insensitive to failures and noise in on-line data measurement. Inimplementing 
an op­timal control, a balance must be struck between the computer power needed for data measurement 
and system control, and that needed for the more complex optimization calculations. This paper is concerned 
with an application of computer based control inthe water supply in­ dustry, involving the use of computer 
graphics and interactive simulation as an alternative to com­ pletely automatic control. Specifically, 
the pro­ blem of optimum operation of pumping stations is examined and a solution developed within this 
 framework. This problem of optimizing pumping costs in water supply networks is of great interest 
to wa­ter engineers and managers who are faced with e­ver increasing electrical pumping bills for sup­plying 
consumers with their daily water needs. This has led to a rapid increase in the level of technical sophistication 
in the industry, with many examples of water systems with centralized monitoring and control of important 
hydraulic parameters currently operational, leading to greatly reduced manpower and operating costs. 
 This has led, in turn, to the possibility of building dynamic models of supply networks and ap­plying 
on-line computer-basedoptimal control. The analytical tools for carrying out such an im­plementation 
are available, but the major draw­back isthe lack of confidence that field engi­neers have in such methods, 
and their reluctance to turn the operation of the entire system over to the control of the computer. 
Inadditon, the computer requirements of such a scheme are some­ times prohibitive. Examining the literature 
on the subject of controlling water distribution systems reveals that there have been two basic approaches 
to the problem of optimizing pump operation: a heuris­ tic approach, where control actions are evolved 
 from past operational experience, and a predic­ tive approach, where control actions are deter­mined 
by mathematical analysis of the water tribution system in response to anticipated con­ sumer demands. 
The first approach is suitable for implementation by human operator. Given adequate controls and on-line 
monitoring of plant status a skilled operator can evolve very credible control rules from experience 
of the system, even though uniformity of action can­ not be guaranteed, since different operators react 
to changing conditions indifferent ways. Nevertheless, the method iseasy to implement using hard-wired 
logic or computers. Selected telemetered variables are used for control pur­ poses, and as they exceed 
certain limits sup­plied by the operator as set points, control action at the pumping station iseffected 
in real-time. Such methods, since they are u­ niquely tailored for the particular system, have the significant 
advantage that they are designed by operators well experienced in the operation of the system, and hence 
are well trusted. A natural progression from the heuristic ap­ proach isto introduce closed-loop automatic 
con­trol, where the set-point controls of the pre­ vious method are calculated on-line to minimize operational 
costs and implemented on the plant via the telemetry scheme. This predictive ap­ proach has been used 
extensively inelectrical power networks 7, and gas distribution systems 8. The method reduces the experience 
factor of the heuristic approach by using a mathematical model to compute flow and pressure conditions 
for a pre­dicted consumption pattern inthe network. Con­trol rules can be worked out inadvance and the 
effects of various control policies evaluated. One method of reducing the computational problem for 
controlling water supply networks is to use a regression model9 ,which isbasically a reduced order model 
relating the key variables such as tank levels, pump pressures and flows, and some internal network variables. 
It has the advantage of being simple, easy to implement, and requires only minimal use of computer power. 
The coeffi­cients of the regression model may be generated from on-line telemetered data or from a validated 
network model. The simulation method described in this paper allows the engineer to retain the human 
supervi­sory element for control, while using an off-line minicomputerto guide his decision making. 
 The operator inputs typical daily pump operating stra­tegies using a light-pen and graphics facility, 
and the algorithm computes the total pumping cost of that strategy subject to the network con­ straints. 
The cost calculation includes compo­ nents of unit electricity charge, peak hour maxi­mum demand charge, 
and cost of fuel adjustments. The computed cost isdisplayed, together with a plot of reservoir levels 
over the 24-hour period. The operator may then input an alternative stra­tegy and arrive at an optimum 
solution by contin­uous interaction with the computer. Among the main features of the method are its 
practical usefulness inthe water industry and the ease with which itmay be implemented. 2. Computer 
Control and Cost Evaluation of Pumping The optimal control of pumping inwater sup­ply networks isjust 
part of the overall real-time control problem involved inthe short term opera­tion of such systems. Fig. 
1 illustrates the over­all computer control problem and the relationship between the controller, the 
process, and feedback information from the process to guide the control­ler. Among some of the problems 
of interest in the short-term operational mode are (i)pump scheduling to meet the demands on the system 
at minimum cost and without excessive pump cycling, (ii)waste de­tection to reduce both distributed leakage 
and deliberate wasteful usage, (iii) demand prediction to enable the pump scheduling to be achieved. 
In addition, several other activities such as network analysis and sensitivity studies are of interest 
in the planning phase of water operations. In this present paper, attention is focused on the particular 
problem of pump scheduling by evaluating various pumping strategies. The pump configuration inwhich we 
are interested isshown in Fig. 2,which shows borehole pumps delivering water into a contact tank, whence 
water is high­lifted into the distribution mains for consumption at the various nodes of the network. 
Inaddition to the contact tank, there may be additional floa­ting storage at various nodes of the network 
in the form of reservoirs which fill up during periods of low demand and discharge during periods of 
high demand, thus facilitating an equalization of source high-lift pumping rates. To evaluate the various 
policy options, it is necessary to develop a pumping cost model which gives the total dollar cost of 
a given pumping strategy, and this will now be developed. 2.1 Details of Pumping Charges The total 
electricity charge for pumping 10 consists essentially of three basic items, which are the unit energy 
(kWH) charge, the charge for maximum demand of kVA during any half-hour of the pumping interval, and 
the fuel adjustment charge whose rate is exogenously determined by the Elec­tricity Boards and is representativeof 
the market oil price. Although this isessentially a "con­stant" term inany index of performance, in the 
sense that it is not controllable and is relative­ly fixed, it is included in the cost model for completeness 
to provide a true representationof operating costs. Each of these charges will now be described insome 
detail. Unit Charges These are based on the total energy require­ments of a given pumping strategy 
over a monthly period. This energy isthe time integral of the instantaneous power at the ith pump as 
given by  where ui, AHi and qi are respectively the instan­taneous flow rate, head increase and efficiency. 
Thus the energy units are given by  where the summations are over the time interval (k)and pumps (i)involved. 
 Defining uc, the unit charge, and w, the maximum demand charge as follows  it can be seen that the 
total cost of units at the end of the interval may be expressed as  where q is the unit tariff, which 
depends on both the number of units and the current maximum demand, rn is the night rebate on units, 
and K is the final increment of the pumping interval. Typical examples of q and rn are shown in Fig. 
3. It is not difficult to show that  The first term is the charge for each increase in uc, the second 
term represents the night rebate, and the third term represents a penalty for any increase inmaximum 
demand w. These integrals may be evaluated with reference to Fig. 3. Maximum Demand Charges This charge 
is usually based on the maximum kVA demand at a source station over the tariff period. Ingeneral the 
cost of these units is  where the tariff S(w) isas indicated in Fig. 4. The integral on the right may 
be evaluated accor­ding to  and the other terms may be simply derived from this. The actual tariff charge 
incurred iseither the maximum demand as evaluated above, or the maxi­mum demand evaluated during the 
preceding 11 months, whichever isthe larger. The detailed structure is illustrated in Fig. 4. Fuel Adjustment 
Charges This is a cost adjustment based on the varia­tion in fuel costs to the electricity authority. 
Ittakes the form of a fixed charge per energy unit used, where the charge depends on the amount by which 
the fuel costs per ton vary from a speci­fied amount. Itcan thus be convenientlywritten  where f isa 
constant over the tariff period. While this component of total cost isof rapidly increasing importance 
to water authorities, its rate is exogenously determined and cannot be re­ duced by control of the network. 
It isof impor­ tance, however, in determining if it ispossible for the water utility to use diesel alternators 
 for generating their own power rather than buying power from the grid. A schematic representation 
of the pumping station cost model isgiven in Fig. 5. In some  cases the total maximum demand from all 
the sta­ tions is summated before application of the ap­ propriate tariff, rather than applying it to 
the maximum demand at each station. This variation will depend on the arrangement with the Electri­ 
city Board inquestion. 3. Use of Interactive Computer Graphics in Simulating Policy Alternatives. Based 
on the cost model of the previous sec­tion an interactive simulation program has been developed for implementation 
on a minicomputer graphics system. Fig. 6 illustrates the various steps in the calculation. The user 
inputs, using a light-pen, pump operating strategies over a cer­tain time period (totf)  one for each 
of the n pumps on the network. Given these inputs, the program solves the net­ work equations for important 
pressures and re­ servoir heights. The cost model of section 2 is then used to evaluate the cost of 
the given strategy, and the cost together with the calcu­ lated reservoir heights are displayed graphi­cally. 
The operator can then adjust the inputs interactively until an acceptable control policy isformed. 
 The model used for description of the net­work must be of the simple regression type re­lating only 
the major variables of the network if interactive computation isto be achieved, since the full network 
model involves the solu­tion of large sets of non-linear equations, a task which is not suitable for 
an interactive environment. The time horizon for controls is usually one month for short term operational 
strategies. Inthis case, inaddition to the control inputs, a variable must be set inthe pro­gram which 
indicates the maximum electricity de­ mand charge registered in either the maximum de­mand during the 
current month under simulation or that during the previous 11 months, whichever is larger. Of course, 
to realistically simulate such policies, an estimate of the consumer demand for water must be made. It 
isassumed inthis study that an estimate of this demand isavailable, and techniques have been developed 
elsewhere for this purpose The computer used for the implementation of  this interactive program isa 
DEC GT44 Computer, shown in Fig. 7,which isa powerful Fortran based graphics system. Itconsists of 
a PDP 11/40 cen­ tral processor with 16k words of high speed core memory. 4. Results To illustrate 
the application of the method  to a practical problem, a pressure zone of an actual network inthe United 
Kingdom was examined and interactive simulation was used to compare short term pumping policies and 
to solve a de­ sign problem involving a choice between on-off and variable speed pumping. The East 
Worcestershire Waterworks Company network supplies water to about 200,000 consumers over a 200 square 
mile area near the Bromsgrove and Redditch districts of Birmingham, England. The system is technologicallyadvanced, 
with a high degree of computer control from a central control computer (Kent K70) which is linked by 
radio and landline to all major parts of the net­work. The Bournheath pressure zone of this network 
 is shown in Fig. 8(a), and the time variation of some of the principal parameters isshown in Fig. 
 8(b), as logged from actual telemetered data. Figs. 9 and 10 show the pump characteristic curves for 
the two main pumping stations, Wild­ moor and Bellington, for the currently installed variable speed 
pumps and possible fixed speed pumps. The advantage of variable speed pumping is that the control variable, 
which is the in­ stantaneous pump flow rate, may be set to any value between upper and lower bounds 
as demand conditions on the network vary. With fixed speed pumps, on the other hand, the degrees of 
 control freedom are limited to the points of in­ tersection between the pump head-flow curve and the 
"system" curve, which effectively represents the effect of connection to the network as seen at the 
pumping station. Consequently, as demand conditions vary throughout the day on the net­ work, it is 
not possible to continuously adjust the flow rates to deliver only the demanded quan­ tity of water 
at the required head. From Figs. 9 and 10 itcan be seen that un­ der variable speed operation the Bellington 
sta­tion can deliver between 1 mgd and 2.5 mgd at al­most the peak efficiency of 83%, which clearly 
allows a considerable degree of freedom inchoo­ sing the control setting between these values. Similarly, 
the Wildmoor station can deliver be­tween 1 mgd and 1.5 mgd at about 82% efficiency. In both cases the 
variable speed action ensures that both the head-flow and efficiency-flow curves shift to give efficient 
operation. Thus the speed and head continuously vary with the de­mand over the 24 hour period to ensure 
intersec­tion of the system curve and the head-flow charac­teristic at the specified delivery rate, at 
which the efficiency is also maximum. The situation for the fixed-speed case isal­so illustrated for 
both of these stations. If fixed speed equipment using induction motor dri­ ven pumps with throttle control 
isinstalled, the degree of control freedom isconsiderably reduced. Inboth cases, the pumps only operate 
at peak ef­ficiency for conditions of average demand, and are consequently less efficient. For the Bellington 
station the efficiency drops to 75% for periods of low demand and to 80% for periods of high de­mand, 
with similar reduction for the Wildmoor station. Consider now the use of the interactive sim­ulation 
program described inthe previous section for comparing pumping strategies using the vari­ble speed pumps 
currently installed on the sy­stem. Fig. 11 illustrates the consumer water de­mand, inmillion gallons 
per day, on the Bourn­heath zone and the possible pump flow policies at Bellington and Wildmoor pumping 
stations. These policies are drawn on the graphics screen using a light-pen, and the minicomputer is 
programmed to read 48 half-hourly flow values per day. Once this information isprocessed, the cost is 
printed on the graphics screen and the integrated re­servoir heights associated with the flow policies 
are displayed. In Fig. 11, two possible manual policies shown by dashed lines are displayed, to­gether 
with the optimal policy which is arrived at by trying out several alternatives and choosing the least 
cost solution. The first manual policy halves the pumping rate at Bellington between 8 a.m. and 12 noon, 
and discharges the reservior during this period. The second manual policy keeps both Bellington and Wildmoor 
reasonably con­stant over the 24 hour period, with a slight re­duction inthe Bellington output to allow 
the re­servoir level to fall. After performing several iterations, the third policy isobtained. This 
keeps the Bellington output absolutely constant at 2.15 mgd, pumping at about 80% efficiency, and slightly 
increases the Wildmoor output between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. from 1 mgd to 1.15 mgd. This produces 
the 10% amplitude reservoir cycle illustrated. The other method of implementing the opti­mal control 
strategy involves using fixed speed induction motor driven pumps with throttle con­trol, where the flow 
output is physically re­stricted to the values shown in Fig. 9. Now the Bellington station operates at 
constant output with both pumps on and the operation at near peak efficiency. The Wildmoor station operates 
with one pump on and the flow restricted to 1 mgd or 1.15 mgd. This involves the throttling of the head 
and operation at about 77% efficien­cy. Thus, it can be seen that the choice of variable speed as opposed 
to fixed speed on-off pumping may be examined using the interactive program. 5. Cost Savings To compare 
these modes of operation, it is necessary to evaluate the various control stra­tegies over a one month 
period to see what savings the optimization calculation will give over more conventional manual and on-off 
control. The stra­tegy of half-hourly flow set-points is input to the model ineach case, as illustrated 
in Fig. 11, and the total cost of that policy obtained. Table 1 summarizes the percentage savings in 
operating costs to be derived by using the optimal policy as opposed to the two manual policies and the 
case of on-off pumping. Itcan be seen that the main savings are on maximum demand charges ra­ther than 
unit costs. In the comparison of varia­ble speed optimal control with on-off control, it isclear that 
savings of about 5% can be made on both maximum demand and unit charges if variable speed equipment isused. 
Inaddition to the other practical benefits of such equipment, which have been well documented elsewhere 
11, it is clear that percentage savings of this kind on rapidly increasing pumping costs in the water 
industry are very worthwhile.  6. Conclusions This paper has developed an algorithm which is suitable 
for comparing alternative pumping strate­gies inwater supply networks and is simple enough for implementation 
on a graphics based minicompu­ter system. As an illustration of the method, pumping strategies on a pressure 
zone of the East Worcestershirewater network in England are examined, using a DEC GT44 graphics system, 
and the results of the investigation demonstrate the use­fulness of interactive graphics in this applica­tion.

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICS FOR COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN INCIVIL 
ENGINEERING John L.Wilson Dept. of Civil and Urban Engineering University of Pennsylvania ABSTRACT 
 Interactive computer graphics can be an effec­ tive and efficient aid in the analysis/design cycle of 
engineering problems. The vistas of much engineering research and design can be expanded with the tools 
and methodology available with the introduction of an interactive computer graphics (ICG) system into 
an academic or industrial envi­ ronment. Specific attention isgiven in this pa­ per to new areas of application 
of ICG in civil engineering; guidelines for the planning of ICG systems; practical applications in bridge 
design and shipbuilding; and economic considerations in­ volved inusing ICG systems. 1. INTRODUCTION 
 This paper focuses on the principal factors in­volved in the successful implementation of an in­teractive 
computer graphics (ICG) system for compu­ter-aided design. The general purpose of this work is to provide 
a framework for discussing: sound interactive procedures; means of enriching the en­vironment for the 
users of graphics systems; and the economic feasibility of using these systems.The objective herein isnot 
to dwell on the speci­fic algorithms used incivil engineering design.Rather, some of the important considerations 
and methodologies are presented and assessed. Engineers and computers have attained a sophis­tication 
whereby methods are being developed to optimize their respective functions in the inte­grated man-machine 
system. Itis desirable to maximize the engineers' creativity and impromptu learning ability; likewise, 
itis desirable to maximize the computers' programmedability to process data. Interactive computer graphics, 
in particular,  can present an engineer or decision-makerwith information regarding a proposed structure 
or re­sults of an analysis in a graphic, comprehensible form and at a much faster rate than achieved 
pre­viously. Italso permits an overall unification of the design process so that the designer will he 
 able to examine alternative schemes ingreater depth and achieve a greater feeling for the response of 
a physical system. The following sections of the paper are oriented to members of the academic and industrial 
community Charles R.Lansberry Structural Analysis Group, Corporate Science and Technology, Sun Shipbuilding 
and Dry Dock Co. to further a successful coupling of research acti­ vities with actual design. The thrust 
is to syn­ thesize some known concepts for system development which have been used in recent years plus 
certain methodologies used at the University of Pennsyl­ vania (1)and the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock 
 Company (2,3). 2. NEEDS AND USES OF THE ICG SYSTEM IN CIVIL ENGINEERING The vistas of much engineering 
research and de­sign can either be "opened-up" or expanded with the tools and methodology available from 
the inser­tion of computer graphics hardware and software into an industrial or academic organization. 
The areas of application for computer graphics inimproving not only productivity but also in gaining 
further insights into the response of phy­sical man-made environments (structures, transpor­tation and 
water systems) are extensive. With the continued improvements in ICG systems itnow ap­pears as though 
they will have a significant impact on the education of students; the designs of prac­ticing engineers; 
and perhaps even more important­ly, on planning groups, public officials and deci­ sion-makers. To illustrate, 
a brief description is next given to some of the work that iseither in progress or has been completed 
at the University of Pennsyl­vania. First, an interactive modeling system for curved bridge analysis 
has been developed utilizing the method of finite elements (4). The interactive modeling system which 
communicates with the user through a problem-oriented language, permits the user to easily define the 
parameters which charac­terize the structure, such as radius of curvature, width, span length, etc.; 
modify an already exist­ing structure; and obtain graphical displays of various structural components 
and various results of analysis such as deflections and stress resul­tants. The results of this project 
have shown ob­vious savings in time in considerably reducing the error-prone process of manual input 
of finite ele­ment data and in reducing the debilitating process of interpretation of thousands oflines 
of tabular output. Also, of at least equal significance, de­signers of these complex bridge structures 
will be able to consider alternative designs ingreater 89 depth via parametric variations studies. 
Thus, there will be savings inall aspects of structural analysis/designcosts. Two very practical applications 
now under study at Penn involving planning and decision-makingare next discussed. Under the terms of 
the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and subsequentguidelines, the Federal decision-makingprocess 
must consider ef­ fects on environmental amenities as well as techni­ cal feasibility and the cost/benefit 
analysis. The final decision ismade frequently on the basis of either extensive data tabulations or 
a single num­ ber index. The development of ICG methods for en­ vironmental analysis can provide the 
decision-maker with a visual representation of the data's signi­ ficance (5). Thus, with the aid of 
graphics as an interpretive tool, the decision-makingprocess will become facilitated and rationalized. 
 As an example of the potential of ICG, consider the gamut of flood control options for a drainage basin. 
These range from land use restrictions to stream channelization to dam construction. A key environmental 
effect isthe impact on the land­ scape. The task of the decision-makerwould cer­ tainly be eased given 
an interactive computer­ based movie depicting the landscape changes as a function of project option. 
This approach can be extended to include an assessment of longer-term secondary impacts such as pictorialization 
of re­ creation development impacts. Also, in connectionwith decision-makingand interdisciplinary problem-solving,work 
is under­way on interactive simulation techniques for the response of communities to natural hazards 
(6,7)-­specifically earthquakes and floods. The comple­ tion of these programs will enable agencies and 
 communities to compare the relative costs and benefits of different programs to homeowners, in­ stitutions, 
and governmental agencies. The in­ terested user groups will incorporate their own values and constraints 
into the framework provided by the modeling system to arrive at policies with respect to hazard mitigation 
and financial recov­ery. The modeling system will enable one to examine the effects of many factors 
(engineering,social and economic) on many interacting units (house­holds, institutions and government). 
Because of the vast amount of data and computations required, the modeling system will obviously be 
implemented on a digital computer. The interactive model will enable a user to compare a variety of policies 
 and levels of disaster easily and rapidly. Unfortunately, however, the full potential of interactive 
graphics inmany areas has not been realized. Although there have been some reports in the technical literature 
of successful applica­tions of interactive graphics inthe design-analy­ sis cycle (1,2,3) acceptance 
by the industrial community has lagged far behind developments in the research and academic communities. 
Some im­portant aspects for the successful usage of ICG systems are discussed next.  3. PLANNING OF 
SYSTEMS The principal idea underlying an integrated system for computer-aided design is to provide a 
system of linked modules and segments inwhich in­ formation sets or blocks are repeatedly joined, pro­cessed 
and possibly distilled, and separated at in­terfaces. In these systems the required rate of information 
transfer is so high that a host of both technical and human factors must be considered in the planning 
of non-alienating ICG systems. In fact, there probably is no identifiable straightfor­ward or unique 
combination of hardware-software-en­vironment based on the variety of human factors considered. Therefore, 
any quantitative ranking of priorities must be viewed with some caution and flexibility in assessing 
the acceptability of pro­posed systems (8). This section of the paper attempts to relate the complex 
manner in which the human and technical factors are interwoven. The list isnot exhaustive but is rather 
intended to serve as a general guide­line of considerations for the planned usage of an ICG system. Brief 
consideration emphasizing the salient points follows. a. Determine if there is a need for an ICG system. 
Based on previous discussions it appears that ICG will have a significant role inallowing increased display 
of creativity and innovativeness of engineers inmany diverse areas. Inaddition there are areas which 
re­quire the use of ICG, e.g., investigationsor studies on the conceptualizationof mathemati­cal models. 
 b. Identify the nature of this need. The sys­tems may take on a variety of functions to as­sist either 
in the learning or decision-making process. For example, increasing usage of ICG systems istaking place 
in the following areas: student education; consulting engineering; ar­chitectural work, interdisciplinary 
problem solving; and decision making. c. Establish functional, performance, and op­eration requirements 
of the system. These must permit some latitude inseveral areas such as interfaces and standardsfor the 
transfer of technology through computer programs. This will help to ensure that rigid and/or inferior 
 constraints are not imposed that will inhibit effective applications. d. Consider both the type of 
input from the user and the flexibility of expression for ef­fective communicationwith the ICG system. 
The input may be classified as graphic, numeric or textual--each of which may impose different considerations 
in the design or selection of a system. Further, the flexibility of expression permitted to the user 
should allow for a natu­ral type of "conversation" and perhaps give the user the feeling that it is an 
attentive lis­ tener and responder. However, caution should be exercised in the sense that too much flexi­bility 
can create some chaos or confusion through ambiguity. e. Consider the image of the computer system  
and its environment to the user. Too often the user is presented with an alienating environ­ment. Generally, 
most initial fears or resis­tance have an exponential decay curve. However, 90 many times these concerns 
are supplanted by a series of continual frustrations of wait and down-time. In fact, at times some 
of our work may best be described as engineer-aidedcompu­ting rather tnan computer-aided-engineering. 
Another frequently neglected or ignored factor involves the all important consideration of system environment. 
Productivity could be greatly enhanced by more attention being given to the surroundings of the system 
such as size of room, color and furnishings. At many instal­lations tne atmosphere isquite unaesthetic 
and distracting. f. Consider alternative systems designs and perform comparative evaluations. This will 
ne­cessitate an examination of alternatives, trade­offs and economics afforded by networks vs. stand-alone 
systems, storage vs. refresh devi­ces and hardware vs. software. There has been considerable discussion 
on these trade-offs since several different types of systems confi­gurations are possible. It isbeyond 
the scope of this paper, however, to develop a compendium of positive and negative arguments for each 
case. It is suggested tnough that each poten­tial user group obtain this information from a variety of 
sources (manufacturers,distributors, and other users) to enable the "best-fit" within given needs and 
resources. g. Evaluate algorithms to be used in the ICG system. There are a number of factors to be considered 
such as: portability and modularity; user understanding and control over basic as­sumptions; reliability 
and validity of the al­gorithms; system efficiency; ease of use and in­terpretation of input/output; 
other user experi­ence and documentation. h. Consider the amount and rate of information transfer. Frequently, 
too much information is presented for tile user to draw conclusions about the validity af the model and 
learn the patterns of the responses. Itis recommended, especiallywith respect to graphic systems, that 
the amount andaccuracyof information be scaled down to avoid confusion. The user should be given the 
choice of obtaining selective output as well as acting as the filter indetermining the importance or 
utility of information in com­plex data.  1. Investigate economics of the proposed sys­ tem. How can 
one configure a system economical­ly? To successfully answer this question is be­yond the scope of this 
paper. However, brief mention ismade of some basic considerations such as: investment costs and savings. 
The "savings" amount isoften difficult to quantify and is only meaningful if the manpower replaced by 
the ICG system can be used productively elsewhere. Itshould also be noted that there is not always a 
direct translation or one-to­one correspondencebetween time and dollars. A few words should be mentioned 
about cost-ben­efit analysis of computer graphics systems. Although tne thought of such an analsis may 
be somewhat unpleasant to those who believe in in­teractive graphics, there must be some yardstick with 
which to measure the relative value of such a system. Unfortunately, few studies have been published 
relating economic principles to the design and implementation of computer graphics. Some concern inan 
economic evaluation isjusti­ fied, in the authors' opinion, not because gra­phics is not cost-effective; 
but rather, be­ cause the quantitative analysis of such systems is performed at a very crude level today. 
This lack of sophistication is due in part to the fact that such graphics systems necessarily in­volve 
interaction with humans, whose performance is always difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, if one accepts 
the hypothesis that the future of design and computer graphics are inexorably linked, interactive graphics 
repre­ sents the most likely medium for computer-aided design to be utilized at its highest level of 
effectiveness. As the number of applications of this technique to the solution of practical de­sign problems 
increases, so will the data base for assessing its effectiveness. Of further significance to an economic 
justification of in­teractive graphics is the fact that the cost of  manpower is continuing to increase 
significantly year by year while the cost of computer services is still continuing to decrease. j. Obtain 
continued evaluation of feedback from users from the ICG system once it is in opera­tion. This will not 
only enhance further usageof the system but hopefully allow the incorpor­ation of modifications or customizing 
based on special requirements of users. Perhaps the best advice one can give the engineer designing 
an interactive graphics system, based on the authors' experience, is to allow for flexibili­ty. Demands 
on and requirements of the system will change with time as more interest is generated in­house. In addition, 
if past trends continue, one can reasonably expect new developments and cost re­ductions in the areas 
of hardware and software. It is the authors' careful intent not to impose rigid or inferior constraints 
on system design since the profession is essentially at an embryonic stage of understanding the full 
implications of interactive graphics in the design process. 4. Practical Applications 4.1 Why Graphics? 
The design and construction of super tankers, roll-on/roll-off vessels, liquid natural gas (LNG) carriers, 
and ecological tankers (complete double hull oil tankers) during the past few years has re­quired an 
accurate method of structural analysis. Many new structural problems are presented by these ships for 
which the designer, and in some instances the classification societies as well, have no past experience. 
The complex nature of these structures is such that the designer and/or structural engi­neer, armed only 
with 'classical solutions,' has sometimes been 'left in the dark' as to stress le­vels induced in parts 
of the ship. Faced with these new problems, the shipbuilding industry has turned to the computer and 
the finite element technique for their solution. For complex, highly redundant structures, such as ships, 
one of the biggest drawbacks to an efficient application of the finite element method is the effort required 
to generate and check input data and display the output in a meaningful format. The use of interactive 
gra­phics as an aid in model generation and debugging is significant. Its use following an execution 
as a method of display and data reduction enables one to further reduce errors, task time-spans, and 
computer and reporting costs. The generation of a structural model using in­ teractive graphics eliminates 
the need for manual creation of detailed drawings, the identification and coding of hundreds of node 
points and element incidences, the key punching and verification of several hundred (or thousand) cards. 
The debugging of a model using graphical play-back allows the user to quickly identify and correct 
model errors. Errors in input nodes and elements stand out clear­ ly on a plot of the structure displayed 
on a gra­ phics tube terminal, particularly when the ability to automaticallyrotate and view the model 
from any position is present. As a pre-processor, interac-' tive graphics saves time by allowing the 
user to quickly generate and thoroughly debug his model. In addition, costs are minimized by frequently 
e­ liminating the need for reruns to obtain correct results due to errors in the model. The output 
associated with a finite element  analysis is voluminous. Graphics provides a means for reduction of 
output data into a visual format and can also be helpful ingenerating material to be used in a report. 
Such graphical tools as ele­ ment and nodal numbering displays, deflected fi­ gures, and iso-plots of 
principal stresses can save substantial amounts of time ininterpretation of results. For example, a 
deflected picture of the structure, by itself or superimposed over the undeflected figure, condenses 
all printed deflec­ tion output into a single visual display. This type of post-processing capability 
reduces the time required to generate a final report. Inter­ actively generated plots are compact, complete, 
 and entirely machine generated. The interactive graphics software presentlyused at Sun Ship is FASTDRAW 
II, a McDonnell Douglas Automation Company proprietary time shar­ing system which interfaces with STRUDL, 
NASTRAN and several other application programs. Access to FASTDRAW isby means of a data phone. The graphic 
 terminal hardware includes a Tektronix 4014 stor­age tube terminal, a Tektronix 4953 digitizing tab­ 
let and a Tektronix 4631 hard copy unit. The hard copy unit is particularly useful in reducing the amount 
of conventional plotting required in an analysis. The cost of leasing the equipment is less than $1000 
per month.  4.2 Design and Analysis of Structural Details At Sun Ship, interactive graphics has been 
a powerful tool in the design and analysis of hull structural details for new classes of ships. Liquid 
Natural Gas carriers, ecological tankers, and largespecialized roll-on/roll-off container ships repre­ 
sent new types of ocean going hulls. The design of structural details for these ships represents, per­haps, 
one of the most important aspects associated with the development of the overall hull girder strength 
and integrity. Interactive graphics per­mits a fast and accurate change in the particulars of a detail 
to reflect the results of a recent analysis. Inaddition, various design alternatives can be quickly generated 
and analyzed from a 'stan­dard,' or basic, detail model. Results may then be compared to determine the 
'best' alternative. Standard details such as transverse web frames, longitudinal girders, stringers, 
bulkheads and brackets can be stored in the graphics system for recall and modification at a later date 
to conform to a particular analysis. Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 show four possi­ble structural configurations 
at the intersection of a deck transverse and vertical web at the side shell of a roll-on/roll-offcontainer 
ship. The finite element model for Design No. 1 (Figure 4.1) was generated first using ICG. Each of 
the three remaining design alternatives (Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4) was created from the basic model in 
an inter­active mode by adding or deleting elements and members as necessary. Figures 4.5, 4.6 and 
4.7 are finite element mo­dels of typical structural connections in an eco­logical tanker (adouble hulled 
oil tanker). A plane stress finite element analysis was performed for each of these details to determine 
the adequacy of the design. Generation of models for details such as these begins with a rough sketch 
of the fi­nite element mesh to be used in the analysis. The sketch is prepared by land and serves as 
a guide duringtheinteractive graphics session. The actual procedure followed during the interactive 
genera­tion phase is a function of the particulars of the detail, the capabilities of the graphics software 
and the ingenuity of the user. 4.3 Economic Considerations Specific figures for a time and cost comparison 
of manual versus ICG generation of the detail shown in Figure 4.7 have been reported elsewhere(2). In 
general, experience at Sun Ship has demonstrated that the number of man-hours required for model gen­eration 
and checking of details such as those shown in Figures 4.1 -4.7 has been reduced by 45 -80% with interactive 
graphics. This reduction is sig­nificant in that practical experience has shown that 60 -70% of the man-hours 
required for a typi­cal finite element application are involved with the generation of bulk data. Thus 
far, the advan­tages of ICG that have been realized at Sun Shipinclude an increase in the efficiency 
and produc­tivity of the engineer as well as a reduction in the cycle time for investigating new structural 
details. The cost of using ICG has been found to be ap­proximately the same as that associated with the 
manual approach (2). It is felt that the economic aspects are satisfactory at present, and will con­tinue 
to improve as increased competition is real­ized in the area of graphics in the computer net­work service 
industry. Furthermore, as engineering man-hour costs continue to rise, the use of graphics will become 
even more attractive as a pre­and post-processorof information.  4.4 Problems Encountered The problems 
encountered at Sun Ship with ICG are primarily related to the physical configuration of the system. These 
problems emphasize the impor­tance of some of the items to be considered in planning an ICG system; i.e., 
functional, perfor­mance and operational requirements, alternative system designs, and rate of information 
transfer. The system communication rate at present is a  92 relatively slow 30 characters per second. 
As the size and complexity of the structural model in,- creases, this slow line speed accounts for a 
large percentage of the graphics costs in the form of wasted man-hours while waiting for a redraw and 
increased system connect charges. Faster response time is needed for video graphic terminals in a time 
sharing environment. All or part of a file may be lost due to phone line problems. In addition, phone 
problems can re-sult in tne input of incarrect information to the system. Inconveniences caused by the 
inability to connect to the remote computer due to phone prob-lems can be discouraging, especially when 
the engi-neer has a "rush job." Computer down-times and/or "system full, try again later" messages can 
be just as disconcerting as phone problems.- Thus far, experience with ICG at Sun Ship has been favorable. 
Both phone and computer problems are within expected service levels. In planning our ICG system one of 
the most important consider- ations was flexibility. As demands on and re- quirements of tne system cnange 
with time, we an- ticipate modification of tne current configuration to satisfy these needs. 5. CONCLUSIONS 
Interactive graphics can be an effective and efficient aid in the analysis/design cycle. The vistas of 
much engineering research and design can be expanded with the tools and methodology avail-able with tne 
introduction of an interactive com-puter graphics system into an academic or indus-trial environment. 
With the advent of high-speed digital computers a generation ago, we were able to transcend tne analysis-bound 
environment. To-day, it appears possible we shall transcend the design-bound environment through ICG 
systems. Specific attention in this paper was given: to the planning of an ICG system; to practical applications; 
and to economic considerations in-volved in using these systems. Each of these topics are summarized 
in turn. First, tne guidelines developed for the plan-ning of an ICG system involve many complex tech-nical 
and human factors whicn are closely inter-woven. Therefore, any quantitative ranking of priorities must 
be viewed with some caution and flexibility in assessing the suitability of a proposed system. However, 
the framework deve-loped herein is useful to help ensure that ex-penditures of significant amounts of 
time, ef-fort and money are not wasted. Second, the practical applications involved in curved bridge 
analysis and shipbuilding demons-trate the ability of interactive graphics to sig-nificantly reduce the 
time required for bulk data generation and checking. The use of interactive graphics and the finite element 
method has been instrumental in realizing the designs of new classes of ships such as the ecological 
tanker. Une of the side benefits of interactive graphics and an important one from the engineer's stand-point 
in tnis application is its ability to make more interesting tne task of data generation and checking. 
No longer is tnis a boring and time-consuming job; but, ratner, it quickly becomes a challenge to the 
creativity of the engineer. Third, the economic justification is satisfac-tory and it is believed that 
the cost aspects asso-ciated with interactive graphics will continue to improve as increased competition 
is realized in the area of graphics in the computer network service industry. As engineering man-hour 
costs continue to rise, the use of graphics will become even more attractive as a means of data generation 
and model checking in connection with the finite element me-thod. In addition, the rapid developments 
taking place in the graphics hardware industry itself seem to indicate a continued reduction in the cost 
of graphics equipment and a simultaneous increase in capabilities. In conclusion, soom after an introduction 
to graphics, the engineer becomes keenly aware of the power of this tool in the analysis-design cycle. 
Productivity is increased with graphics by reducing the amount of time and drudgery required to complete 
an analysis. For the future. the full ootential of interactive graphics systems-appears lihited only 
the ingenuity and imaginatibn of the user. - REFERENCES 1. J.L. Wilson and S. Shore, "Principles for

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania GRAPHICAL INPUT THROUGH MACHINE RECOGNITION OF SKETCHES Christopher 
F. Herot Architecture Machine Group, Department of Architecture Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts A family of programs has been developed to allow graphical input through continuous 
digitizing. Drawing data, sampled at a high and constant rate, is compressed and mapped into lines and 
splines, in two and three dimensions. This is achieved by inferring a particular user's intentions from 
measures of speed and pressure. Recent experiments have shown that even the most basic inference making 
cannot rely solely upon knowledge of the user's drawing style, but needs additional knowledge of the 
subject being drawn, the protocols of its domain, and the stage of development of the user's design. 
This requirement implies a higher level of machine intelligence than currently exists. An alternate approach 
is to increase the user's involvement in the recognition process. Contrary to previous efforts to move 
from sketch to mechanical drawing without human intervention, this paper reports on an interactive system 
for graphical input in which the user overtly partakes in training the machine and massaging the data 
at all levels of interpretation. The initial routines for data compression employ parallel functions 
for extracting such features as bentness, straightness, and endness. These are planned for implementation 
in microprocessors. Results offer a system for rapid (and enjoyable) graphical input with real-time interpretation, 
the beginnings of an intelligent tablet. 1. INTRODUCTION There are many areas of human endeavor which 
could benefit from the use of computer aids if there existed an effective means of communicating about 
these tasks with a machine. While the field of computer graphics arose to fill that need, it has too 
often added a new level of complexity. In computer-aided design, for instance, the process of "digitizing" 
is suffi­ciently cumbersome to delay its application until a relatively complete design has been produced 
by the human designer. The result is usually more akin to computer-aided evaluation or manipulation than 
to computer-aided design. The research described here is motivated by the desire to involve the computer 
in the early stages of the design process, where the feedback generated by the machine can be most useful. 
The medium chosen is free­hand sketching, as done with pencil and paper, as could be done at a data tablet. 
A machine is postulated to be looking on while the user is sketching. It could make inferences not only 
about the meaning of the sketch but also about the user's attitudes toward, and uncertainties about, 
his design. This approach offers its own unique set of problems and solutions, since the data available 
to the machine are at once plentiful and incomplete. While the ultimate implementation assumes a near-human 
intelligence on the part of the machine, far off in time, there are many interesting things to be learned 
along the way. Our previous experiments[1, 2, 3, 4] have been directed toward the creation of a "passive" 
input system which would make fairly complete inferences about a sketch while requiring a minimum of 
intervention from the user. The programs we used in these projects involved many levels of interpretation. 
From the 100 pen positions sampled each second, the machine would have to find lines, curves, and corners, 
building a description of a two-dimensional object. This description could be interpreted further, possibly 
as a three-dimensional description. The following sections depict three experiments in computer processing 
of sketches. HUNCH, described in the next section, was directed toward answering the following question: 
Does there exist a syntax of sketching, something which could be processed independently of the embedding 
semantics? Could a machine make useful interpretations of a sketch without employing a knowledge of the 
subject domain? The mixed results of that experiment led to the investigation described in section 3, 
a rather ambi­tious effort to make use of architectural knowledge in recognizing a sketch. Finally, section 
4 reports on current work which places more emphasis on user involvement in the input process. 2. THE 
HUNCH SYSTEM HUNCH is a name given to a set of FORTRAN programs which were de­signed to process freehand 
sketches drawn with a data tablet or light pen. Each program performs a different level of interpretation, 
storing its output in a file where it can be used as input by the other programs. Facilities exist to 
display and manipulate various stages of interpretation. The relationships among the programs are illustrated 
below.   The system currently runs under the MAGIC[5] operating system on a 64K is possible to determine 
the speed as well as position at any point in the byte Interdata minicomputer. The MAGIC system allows 
a program to use sketch. any graphical input or output device in a device-independent manner, in­cluding 
a refresh display with light pen, a storage tube, a raster scan display, a large digitizer-plotter, and 
several varieties of data tablets.  The user of the system typically sits down at a table and draws 
with a ballpoint pen on a piece of paper taped to the surface of a data tablet. Considerable effort was 
expended to provide an environment as close to sketching as possible. One of the tablets provided measures 
three feet by  Fig. 2 -Large Data Tablet four feet so as to allow large drawings. A special pencil was 
constructed so that the user could work with the more customary graphite rather than a ballpoint pen.[6] 
The pencil was designed with the additional intention of Finding Curves, Corners, end Lines The original 
HUNCH system was conceived around a program called STRAIT, which found corners in a sketch as a function 
of speed, com­pressing the 100 points per second from the tablet into a much smaller list of endpoints 
of lines. The central assumption was that speed could be interpreted as a measure of intent-a quickly 
drawn line was intended less literally than a slowly drawn one. As a happy coincidence, it also turned 
out that as a result of the finite mass of the pen and hand, the speed necessarily decreased at corners. 
All that was necessary to find corners was to look for minima in the speed function. (Notice the bunching 
of raw data points at the corners in the previous figure.)  Fig. 3 -Pencil making the record on paper 
correspond to the record in the machine. This is achieved by an eraser on the pencil which has its own 
sense coil, so that erasures on the paper can be recorded by the machine, in some sense, such as negative 
line. In the current configuration the computer samples the position of the pen at constant intervals, 
variable under program control from 16 to 200 points per second. The data (100 points per inch in X and 
Y and 3 levels of Z) is stored in a disk file or on magnetic tape. Since the sample rate is constant, 
it Fig. 5 -Speed Function for Figure 4  Curves were considered to be a special case of corners. With 
the assistance of Dr. Richard Riesenfeld we decided to fit them to B-splines[7]. When the curvature of 
a corner was too gradual, or the speed indicated that it was drawn too carefully, the output of the straightening 
program was flagged to cause subsequent invocation of the curve-fitting program. CURVIT would make one 
or more passes over the raw data at places pointed to by the output of STRAIT, producing its own output 
file. Fig. 6 -Output of STRAIN for Figure 4 98 When demonstrating STRAIT and CURVIT to visitors, it 
was somewhat disconcerting to find that it did not always make the same interpretation as the human observers. 
What was still more alarming, however, was that the program worked better for some people's sketches 
than for others. It appeared that the programmer had embedded a particular model of human sketching behavior 
that fit some users more closely than others. The ques­ tion that arose was whether this model could 
be changed simply by varying parameters, and if so, how the correct values of those parameters could 
be determined. Latching A cursory examination of the above figure will reveal that it contains per force 
five endpoints. It would be convenient for programs using this data, such as editors or "square-finders" 
if there were only four endpoints. The first version of STRAIT used a simple latching algorithm which 
joined to­gether any pair of endpoints falling within a fixed radius of each other. This simple "rote 
latching" often produced bizarre results where changes of scale were involved, as illustrated below. 
 With the realization that the latching problem was more complex than originally expected, STRAIT was 
rewritten without latching, hence STRAIN.' Obviously some intelligent means of computing the latching 
radius is needed. In the next experiment, the latching radius is computed as a func­tion of speed, under 
the assumption that the speed provided by STRAIN for each line is also a measure of the user's certainty 
in positioning that line's endpoint. Fig. 7 - Rote Latching Fig. 8 - Latched Cube Fig. 8 -Latched Cube 
As can be seen from the above, speed is not always well correlated with intent. In part this is because 
the speed figure used is the average for the line and does not accurately reflect conditions at the endpoints. 
But there is a more serious difficulty at work here-one which illustrates the inter­dependence of the 
different levels of interpretation. The program errone­ously latched the front and back corners of the 
cube, since their two­dimensional projections happened to coincide. The only sure solution to this problem 
is to compare candidates for latching in three space instead of the (often ambiguous) two-dimensional 
projection. Paradoxically our current GUESS program requires latched data as input in order to determine 
the z-coordinates. The solution will require that some latching decisions be made, perhaps on such syntactical 
considerations as the number of bodies or the sequence of construction, with the provision to modify 
decisions if they prove untenable in the later stages of interpretation. Several approaches to this problem 
will be discussed in subsequent sections of this paper. Overtracing Although not handled at all by the 
original HUNCH system, overtracings present many of the same problems as latching. Once again the process 
is one of reducing the quantity of data by making inferences about the user's  intentions, turning several 
lines into one line. The program must distinguish between two carefully drawn parallel lines and one 
wide, overtraced line. The amount and style of overtracing may serve as a measure of a particular user's 
attitude toward the design, with heavy overtracing indicating em­phasis or reinforcement of selected 
areas. Other Levels of Inference In addition to the processes already mentioned, there are many other 
pos­sible directions of interpretation. One of them involves inferring the third dimension of axonometric 
or perspective drawings. The currently imple­mented program makes use of some simple rules of projective 
geometry to map two-dimensional networks of lines into three-dimensional data structures. Fig. 9 - Overtracing 
 While easily confused by lines drawn in other than the three primary axes, the algorithm has enabled 
experimentation with manipulation of three­dimensional structures and cast some light on the interdependencies 
of latching and finding the third dimension. Another type of interpretation is illustrated by a program 
which finds rooms and their connections in a floor plan. This program maps the raw data onto a two dimensional 
grid. Any point having a line pass through it is set to one. By mapping cells into an array at a suitable 
scale, any degree of detail may be chosen. The room-finding algorithm simply looks for areas of zeros 
completely surrounded by ones. Needless to say, the program works well for simple floor plans that conform 
to the programmer's original expec­tations. It works less well with odd-shaped rooms and doorways which 
 might not be doorways, as in the upper right room in the above figure. In this case, the choice of 
the "correct" interpretation is not so easy. In fact, it probably varies not only with different users, 
but also with different contexts. In architectural applications, the concept of "room" is usually less 
important than the ways in which the space is perceived and used-a level of inference perhaps above or 
perhaps equivalent to that of finding rooms. A human observer resolves these ambiguities through the 
application of personal knowledge and years of learning how to look at pictures. Each line Fig. 11 - 
Room Finding takes on meaning only in the context of the drawing and its subject matter. Before a machine 
can effectively communicate with a human user about a sketch it must possess a similar body of knowledge 
and experience.  3. USE OF CONTEXT As suggested by the preceding descriptions, sketch recognition requires 
more than a simple hierarchical interpretation of the data. Although the programs described are usually 
run in sequence, the interpretations to be made are not independent. The bottom-up approach is hindered 
by the lack of any contextual information. In contrast to human vision, for example, where knowledge 
of what to expect in a sketch is involved in seeing things as detailed as individual lines, the HUNCH 
system operates solely on the basis of syntactic evidence. Its success can be attributed to its use of 
data not available to the human observer, such as speed and sequence. The answer to the question posed 
at the beginning-is there a syntax of sketching independent of the semantics?-is still unresolved. While 
there is room for considerable improvement in the low-level inference-making routines, latchers that 
look for closure, overtracing routines that consider sequence, etc., it seems that a truly successful 
system would have to make use of context at the lowest levels. Such a context would have to include not 
only what the person is sketching but also the stage of completion of the sketch and the design, the 
idiosyncracies of the person, and his or her attitudes toward the design. The knowledge of the sketching 
domain has to be structured in such a way that it can be used to direct the machine's analysis of the 
sketch, supplying goals to direct the low-level routines in their search for lines, curves, and corners 
and supplying enough information about what is plausible in the sketch to resolve ambiguities and fill 
in missing information. This knowledge also must be in a form that can be easily understood and modified 
by the machine so that a sketch-recognition system could be constructed which lends itself to diverse 
applications simply by changing the knowledge base. A scheme employing these principles was explored 
in [9] and is synopsized in the following paragraphs. The act of recognizing a sketch thus involves drawing 
a sketch for the machine and specifying the "context" to avoid the more difficult problem 100 of "context 
recognition". This context specification might be as specific as "suburban homes" or "machine screws," 
or it might be as general as "built form" or "tools." The context description is structured as a network 
con­taining general case descriptions, for example: This structure is matched against the context-free 
data structure generated by the low-level HUNCH routines to generate a composite structure where all 
of the syntactic entities of the sketch are assigned a meaning. The match-  Fig. 14 -Instantiated Structure 
ing operation takes place in a top-down fashion. That is, the machine attempts to find an instance of 
the top-level general case node in the specific data structure. In the example structures, a search would 
be performed for a room. Since there is nothing labeled "ROOM" in the data structure, the program searches 
for components of a room, specifically walls, which find their match in the lines of the data structure. 
The process is, of course, more complicated than a simple recursive depth­first matcher, since the general 
case description will not match exactly, but only in part. If a required line does not exist in the data 
base, it may be necessary to reinvoke the line finder, which may have thrown away a line the first time. 
A yet more difficult problem is posed by erroneous or pre­ mature matches: the system is only as good 
as the matching machinery. Either some method must be provided for withdrawing incorrect matches, necessitating 
a control structure employing backup, or the matching process must be made more breadth-oriented, requiring 
a sophisticated pattern matcher which can look around and size up the situation before making a match. 
A preliminary system using the first approach was implemented in the CONNIVER[10] language, an artificial 
intelligence (Al) language which allows construction of complex control structures and provides facilities 
for maintaining and searching a data base. Unfortunately, the CONNIVER pro­ gram, while small in capability, 
consumed enormous amounts of computer time and memory. Any attempt to expand the capabilities of this 
modest program led directly into the same (vast) problems encountered by Al re­searchers working on machine 
vision or natural language. It appeared that the knowledge-based approach would require a rather large, 
permanent detour away from the initial problem of providing a graphical input facility. 4. TOWARD AN 
INTERACTIVE SYSTEM The most promising approach seems to be a much more interactive system, one involving 
the user to make decisions of which the machine is not capable, but still affording the unobtrusive input 
method of sketching. The program must take into consideration the interdependence of different levels 
of interpretation. The bottom-up flow of information operates as in the HUNCH system, except that the 
data base is more integrated than the disparate disk files of HUNCH. The top-down flow, which is one 
of the strong points of the context-based system, comes from the corrections and manipulations of the 
user, as well as from higher-level programs. These capabilities require a much more integrated and interactive 
facility than is provided by HUNCH. Such a system forms the basis of our current work and is described 
in this section. The new system consists of a data base and a set of programs to manipulate it. The 
data base is stored as PL/1-based structures, capable of being paged from a disk. Each time a new level 
of interpretation is encountered, a corresponding level is added to the data base. Pointers are maintained 
to show relationships between elements at different levels. For example, when two points are latched 
together, pointers are stored at the latched level to show which two STRAIN points make up the new single 
latched point. As in the HUNCH system, there are three kinds of programs which use the data base: Inference 
programs are improved versions of STRAIN, LATCH, OVER- TRACE, and GUESS. Each one employs tests of reasonableness 
to its output and can be controlled by means of a well-defined set of param­ eters. Display programs 
allow displaying any (or all) levels of the data base on selected output devices. Manipulation programs 
have been combined into a graphical editor which permits the user to modify the data base directly. 
Finding Lines and Curves If the new sketching system is to be truly interactive, STRAIN must operate 
in real time, finding lines and curves on the fly, while the user is drawing, instead of after the fact. 
The program must lend itself to "tuning" to the hand of the individual user. Accordingly, the new program 
is based on a set of functions, each of which measures some characteristic of the sketch over an inverval 
of variable but specified size and position. Two of the most useful functions are speed and "bentness," 
which are shown below for a square composed of 95 sample points.  Speed measures the length of the interval 
divided by the number of points in that interval. Bentness measures the maximum of the distances from 
the points to the chord connecting the endpoints of the interval. By varying the number of points in 
an interval, the number of peaks in the output can be controlled. A large interval filters out peaks 
resulting from local, high­frequency variations, while a small interval will show up every tiny variation 
in the sketch. This interval length is one parameter which can be varied to get the closest fit between 
the machine's interpretation and the user's in­tentions. For example, if the program were told that the 
user has drawn a square, it could vary the size of the interval until the two functions pro-The latcher 
can attach a certainty factor to each of its local decisions, based duced exactly five peaks (remember 
that one corner, per force unlatched, is on parameters such as speed and line length. These decisions 
can then be both a beginning point and an endpoint). examined more globally in the light of the criteria 
mentioned above. Since Given these two functions, they can be combined so as to indicate intended lines 
and curves. The contributions of the different functions are deter­ mined by a set of coefficients which 
can be varied for individual users. Bentness is used to find the actual corners in a sketch, while speed 
is used to indicate whether they are really intended as corners. These functions will eventually be computed 
by microprocessors, so that the main program will see a tablet which produces not only X, Y and Z but 
also speed, bentness, corners, and curves. The raw data will still be saved, along with the function 
values, so that other programs can examine the data. The line/curve finder will be tunable both explicitly 
and implicitly. Explicit tuning is accomplished through a command which enables the user to modify the 
program's parameters to produce the most satisfactory result. It is envisioned that implicit tuning 
will be performed by means of the editor. If the user inserts points, creating corners in the data base, 
the system can change its parameters to generate more points. If the user deletes points, that serves 
as an indication that the corner-finding program is generating too many corners. 153 Words About Control 
Structure Unlike HUNCH, where the user explicitly invoked programs such as STRAIN and LATCH, the new 
sketching system runs its inference-making procedures in the background, so that they will not cause 
interruptions in the sketching and thinking processes of the user. Placing the pen on the tablet immediately 
starts the line/curve finder, adding the new lines and curves to the data base. Whenever the user is 
not drawing, the higher-level programs, such as OVERTRACE and LATCH, are run. These programs look for 
any changes or additions to the data base, such as would result from drawing, editing, or running other 
inference making programs. A program which modifies the input level of another program causes that program 
to be run. Conversely, any program may decide that its input data level is unsatisfactory and request 
the program which created that level to regene­rate it, perhaps using new parameters. Latching Revisited 
In view of the new data base and control structure, it may be useful to examine the metamorphosis of 
the latcher from a stand-alone program to part of an integrated system. Latching is an interesting problem 
from many viewpoints. While its ultimate solution requires a knowledge-based system, there are many clues 
available to the program which are independent of the subject matter being drawn. These include closure, 
changes in size or angle, and the number of lines latched to a point.  those criteria tend to bias the 
interpretation in certain directions, their use will have to be controlled by a profile of the user created 
from a history of corrections he makes to the output of the latcher. On a more local level, these corrections 
can be used to control parameters such as the latching radius. By allowing profiles to be generated on 
an individual person/subject basis, some of the benefits of subject-area-based systems can be acquired. 
Another problem in latching is the determination of the scale at which the designer was working. This 
problem is exemplified by the drawing in Figure 7 where the windows were drawn at a smaller scale than 
the house. The program, assuming one scale, used two large a latching radius on the windows, latching 
too many points together. Scale will have to be deter­ mined by use of various clues, such as the "busy-ness" 
of a part of a sketch, as measured by the density of lines drawn nearby in soace and in time. The sequence 
of line input can be another useful clue since, for example, the two faces of a cube will probably form 
two separate clusters if divided by sequence. Once again this is a user-dependent property. CONCLUSION 
Progress in sketch recognition has in a sense come full circle from an insis­tence on machine recognition 
with no demands on the user, through knowledge-based systems, and back to a more modest interactive approach. 
It is our intention to involve the user in the way most meaningful to his design, through editing the 
machine's interpretation of his drawing to bring it into agreement with his own intentions. Our experiments 
have shown sketching to be a viable medium through which a person can communicate to a machine. The next 
question to be answered is. What balance can be struck between an intelligent but unwieldy system, and 
a tiresome but practical one? REFERENCES [1] Negroponte, Nicholas, and James Taggart, "HUNCH-An Experiment

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania RECOGNITION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS FROM ORTHOGRAPHIC 
VIEWS By Gilles Lafue Institute of Physical Planning School of Urban and Public Affairs and Department 
of Architecture. Carnegie-Mellon University Pittsburgh. Pa. ABSTRACT: This paper presents a program interpreting 
orthographic drawings input through a digitizing tablet into three­dimensional (3-D) objects. Ambiguity 
arises in such a task not only in the case of two views but also with three-view inputs, due to coinciding 
projections of vertices. The main effort consists in heuristically reducing this ambiguity. The general 
strategy is a bottom-up identification of the objects starting with the tablet-coordinates and aggregating 
them into vertices, then faces and finally polyhedra. The program does not contain any high level geometrical 
concepts or probable properties of 3-D objects but only some basic definitions of polyhedra (as expressed 
by Euler and Mobius). By applying these definitions to different parts of the scene to recognize, it 
defines local sets of alternatives and then chooses the right ones by running a mini theorem prover over 
these sets. A major issue in writing this program has been to limit the drawing constraints imposed on 
the user. In case that it gets blocked in the recognition process, however, the program can require the 
user's help. INTRODUCTION Investigations and at least one realization have been carried out in using 
orthographic projections to graphically input three-dimensional objects into a computer [8]. However, 
it has not been completely satisfactory from the user's standpoint because of the constraining rules 
that he has to observe in entering data. This paper presents a program translating orthographic projections 
of objects into a useful three-dimensional shape data structure. Like its predecessor it can not allow 
curves (they have to be approximated by planar faces) but we believe that it realizes some improvement 
in reducing other constraints imposed on the user. The program is an input module of a larger system, 
called BDS, aimed at storing and manipulating 3-D elements relevant to physical design [1], It decomposes 
the objects that it recognizes into topologies (i.e. sets of non-metric relationships between faces, 
edges and vertices) and geometries (i.e. sets of coordinates instantiating the topologies) to be transferred 
to BDS. [2] The input device is a digitizer tablet on which one draws the orthographic views. It records 
coordinates of points pointed to with a pressure higher than a certain threshold. Thus the user can draw 
on a sheet of paper put on the tablet with apressure moderate enough to avoid the coordinate recording, 
in order to keep track of what he is inputting, and press a little harder at vertices that he wants to 
enter. Two consecutive vertices are assumed to be linked by a straight edge. One of the main changes 
in input constraints, as compared with the previous program, is the use of the "single pointing" mode 
instead of the "double pointing" mode. The latter consists in pointing to two projections of a point 
at a time, so that extracting the 3-D coordinates from the pair of 2-D coordinates is immediate. Views 
are drawn simultaneously. With the single pointing mode, views are supposed to be independent from each 
other at input time. They can be entirely drawn one after the other or on different tablets. Associating 
projections is left to the program. The most obvious advantage of single pointing is its practicability. 
It is more natural and quicker to concentrate on one view and then deal with another one (note however 
that the user is still free to go back and forth between views). Another improvement felt by the user 
is that he does not have to draw every face in a certain direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depending 
on whether it is visible or not. The visible or invisible property of faces and edges is not specified 
to the program whatsoever. This, combined with the independence of views, frees the user from having 
in mind a 3-D internal image of objects in order to draw them in two dimensions. Note however that this 
freedom to "think" in two dimensions is a little impinged on by the fact that it remains firstly that 
views are to be drawn face-wise (i.e. a view is a collection of faces and not only of edges*), and secondly 
that all faces projected onto a view (i.e. not perpendicular to it) have to be drawn, whether they are 
seen or not. Finally, faces can be any closed polyhedron. There is no restriction on the number of vertices 
that a face can contain but the last vertex must be the same as the first one. This is used to delimitate 
faces at input time. The single pointing input mode is the source of most of the differences between 
the approach adopted here and in previous works. As it will become clear later on, associating projections 
often generates ambiguity, which may not sound surprising as long as two views are given but also remains 
true with three views (although to a lesser extent). Such ambiguity results in assuming more vertices 
(and consequently faces) than actually exist and therefore necessitates some device to depict and eliminate 
the surplus vertices. Our decision has been to supply the program with some means to cope with it rather 
than to oblige the user to avoid it.  FIG. 1 Ambiguities of edge-wise input. (b) is the top view of 
(a). What vertices are linked: 1 and 2, 1and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4 or 3 and 4 ? Because of these 
surplus vertices, object recognition is achieved through agenerate-and-test strategy. We often need information 
about what is possible before knowing what is true. On the other hand, in many cases, the difference 
between the number of possible faces and the number of true faces is small. The problem is not to select 
a small subset of a large set of alternatives with a simple evaluation function but rather to select 
a relatively large subset of a limited set of alternatives with a more complicated evaluation function. 
The input recognition is primarily bottom-up. Initially the system is only given a stream of tablet-coordinates, 
that is, atomic pieces of information. From coordinate pairs it has to recognize the particular polyhedra 
meant by the user as expressed in his drawing. The program does not contain a sophisticated network of 
high level geometrical concepts allowing recognition of objects of most common topologies on global properties 
and making good guesses in ambiguous situations such as in human recognition and some previous work in 
machine vision [3], [9]. It only knows a few basic properties of edges and vertices. The emphasis has 
been on generality. No decision is based on particularities of some shapes or topologies but on general 
laws. The objects to be interpreted are what we call Bodies, namely polyhedra that can be assigned avolume. 
A polyhedronis a system of polygons arranged in such a way that exactly two polygons meet (at an angle) 
at every edge and that it is possible to get from every polygon to every other polygon bycrossing edges 
of the polyhedron. Mobius has shown, however,that some closed polyhedra cannot be assigned any volume 
(e.g.,the heptahedron, the Mobius's strip, Klein's bottle) but, by considering line-segments, areas and 
volumes as relative magnitudes, as derived from analytic geometry, he also proved that, in order to have 
a volume, a polyhedron must be two-sided* (i.e.,every face has one external side and one internal side) 
and that if every face is followed in a given direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) on a given side 
(internal or external) then every edge is followed not only twice but also in oppposite directions [4],[5]. 
We shall call faces drawn by the user P-Faces (for Projected Face) in order to distinguish them from 
spatial faces (that we simply call Faces). A Face is projected onto two or three P-Faces. Similarly, 
we distinguish P-Edges and Edges as well as P-Vertices and Vertices. Holes in Faces are allowed under 
the condition that the user adds artificial P-Edges to the P-Faces containing them. A hole in a Face 
yields two disconnected rings of Vertices, which violates the Face definition. Therefore, in order to 
avoid interpreting such a Face as two different Faces, the two separate Vertices rings have to be artificially 
connected (cf. fig. 2). As one can see in fig. 2, holes are not the only features requiring P-Faces to 
be drawn with artificial Edges: every closed chain of Edges that does not separate the Body into two 
regions requires such an EdgeA. Of course, artificial Edges cannot be considered as other Edges, and 
in particular they are not analyzed (cf. 3.2). FIG. 2. Examples of input where artificial edges are 
needed to connect separate rings in a same face. -1-VERTICES IDENTIFICATION. 1.1.Initializations Before 
all else the user is asked to initialize a few basic variables: Firstly, he specifies his drawing tolerance. 
Most tablets have a resolution greater than hand precision, and for this reason a coordinate system with 
unit equal to the drawing tolerance is mapped onto the original tablet system. Coordinates of all points 
falling into a given coordinate zone of the drawing tolerance system will be standardized. This way, 
not only can the user define the precision desired but orthogonality to ground lines is also insured. 
Secondly, he defines ground lines. He does so by entering a point whose y-coordinate will define the 
horizontal ground line and then by entering apoint whose x-coordinate will define the vertical ground 
line. He can ignore one of the two if he wants to input only two views. Thirdly, he chooses the interpretation 
mode: single-body mode in which bodies are inputted and interpreted one by one or multiple-body mode 
in which sets of bodies are inputted and interpreted at a time. 1.2. Vertices Identification. Orthographic 
projection is considered here by itself and not as a subdomain of perspective. Transforming a set of 
two or three 2-D coordinates into a 3-D vertex is therefore straightforward and does not require an algorithm 
allowing for the general case of perspective (when the eye is not infinitely far away) such as the ingenious 
one developed by Parke [7] and Sutherland [8]. First, by comparing the tablet coordinates of the projections 
with those of the ground lines, projections of vertices are sorted into two or three views and tablet 
coordinate pairs are transformed into 3-D coordinate pairs. Then, in one view, say P1, each P-Vertex 
is associated with the set of P-Vertices of the view P2 sharing with it the same value of the coordinate 
common to P1 and P2. The same process is followed with the third view P3, if any. Then, each P-Vertex 
of the set from P2 is associated with the P-Vertex of the set from P3 sharing with it the same value 
of the coordinate common to P2 and P3, if any, and a 3-D vertex is identified by combining this pair 
of coordinates with that of the initial P-Vertex from P1. When all P-Vertices of P1 have thus been treated, 
all Vertices are identified and in the P-Faces, each P-Vertex is now associated with the set of Vertices 
projected onto it. Clearly, in the case of a two view input, more Vertices are likely to be generated 
than in athreeview one because the selection of P-Vertices from P2 through matching with those from P3 
does not exist. Furthermore, even with three views, non-existing Vertices can be generated merely because 
there exists a triplet of P-Vertices on which they could be projected. This is the source of all troubles. 
(cf. fig. 3). -2-EDGES AND FACES IDENTIFICATION. We are now provided with two types of information: P-Faces 
and Vertices. Their combination should give Edges and Faces. A distinction must be introduced now between 
two types of Edges and Faces due to the orthographic representation mode. Side Faces are perpendicular 
to two projection planes. They are particularly troublesome in the case of two-view inputs since they 
are not projected anywhere and consequently not drawn. The definition of Side Face is limited to two-view 
inputs. Side Edges are Edges belonging to Side Faces. Drawn Faces are Faces that are not Side Faces. 
They have been drawn by the user on at least one view. FIG. 3. Example of non existing possible vertices. 
No vertex is projected on (1,1',1") and (2,2',2") although vertices 1 and 2 would be very possible. 
2.1. Drawn Faces Identification. Identifying Drawn Faces consists in selecting for each P-Face all the 
sequences of Vertices projected onto it that can form a Face. A Face is a planar sequence of existing 
Edges. A Drawn Edge exists if and only if it is projected onto all the views to which it is not perpendicular. 
Several simple heuristics are used to reduce the searches involved in this process. 2.2 Side Faces Identification 
Since the information available on Side Faces is null we have to make assumptions about them. The basic 
assumption is that their edges are perpendicular to the views and consequently orthogonal to each other. 
Vertices belonging to a same Side plane are quickly identified by having a common coordinate and are 
gathered. Then, within a side plane, Edges are preselected, i.e.,their existence is declared either False 
or Possible before the Face identification process according to their perpendicularity to the views. 
Side Face identification is conceptually and computationnaly different from Drawn Face identification 
because the given information is no longer Vertices and P-Faces but Side Vertices, Side Edges and Drawn 
Faces. The lack of P-Faces makes it less rigorous than the general Face identification, but, on the other 
hand, it is performed after the identification of Drawn Faces and takes advantage of the information 
that these latter contain. The principle of Side Face Identification is to generate all Possible Side 
Faces containing a Possible Side Edge when this latter does not yet belong to any Side Face. In order 
to be Possible a Side Edge must belong to at least one Drawn Face (see B-Rule (3), 3.1). In addition, 
it is ensured that Side Faces do not contain Side Edges crossing each other, which is simple to do, due 
to orthogonality of Side Edges. -3- FACES SELECTION The Faces (Side or Drawn) generated during the Face 
Identification process are Possible. Our goal now is to sort True Faces and False Faces. The solution 
state of the object recognition at any of its stages is represented by the ambiguity measure consisting 
inthe number of Faces whose existence is Possible. This process is described here for single body objects. 
A later section deals with multiplebody objects Face selection. A Face is projected onto every view to 
which it is not perpendicular. Therefore, the way our Face identification process works, the same Face 
will appear in each of these projection planes. This is recognized and as soon as one of them is assigned 
an existential value True or False, this value is also assigned to the other ones and then only one instance 
of F1 is kept. Whenever a Face is declared True all its edges and vertices are also declared True. However, 
that an Edge is True does not necessarily mean that all the Faces containing it are True but only that 
two of them are. Similarly, that aVertex is declared True implies that at least three of the Faces containing 
it must be True.  The general principle is to gather Faces having a common property into sets (called 
B-Sets). A property defining aB- Set, for example, can be to contain agiven Edge or a given Vertex. In 
addition, to each type of B-Set there corresponds a rule (called B-Rule) that determines the minimum 
and the maximum number of Possible Faces contained in the current B-Set which can be True. In other words, 
in a B-Set, the onlything known about the subset defined by the Possible Faces which happen to be True 
is the lower and upper bounds of its cardinal. Along the selection process, the difference between the 
cardinal of a B-Set and the cardinal of its subset of True Faces will hopefully decrease, until it becomes 
0. At this point, the subset is fully defined; all the Faces of the B-Set (possibly zero) are declared 
True. When several B-Sets intersect each other, that is,when they contain at least one common Face, their 
intersection is analysed with the help of a mini theorem prover which will hopefully result in eliminating 
some Faces and keeping others. 3.1. B-Rules. There are four different B-Rules: (1) The number of Trues 
Faces containing agiven Edge is 2 if the Edge is True and 0 or 2 if it is only Possible (by definition). 
 (2) The number of True Faces in which agiven Edge has a given direction equals the number of True Faces 
in which it has the opposite direction. This is the Mobius'complement to polyhedra definition. (3) There 
cannot be more than one True Face containing a given Edge and belonging to a given plane (Since we are 
 dealing in this section with single objects, two adjacent coplanar Faces are in fact one single Face). 
 (4) The number of True Faces containing agiven vertex is at  least 3 if the Vertex is True and either 
0or at least 3 if it is only Possible. 3.2.Edge Analysis To apply B-Rules (1), (2) or (3) to agiven 
Edge generatesthree B-Sets. It might happen that two of them, or even all of them, are identical. In 
this case, of course, only one B-Set is generated. Formally, this analysis is implemented as a set of 
productions whose conditions are instantiations of B-Rules into the current edge's context and whose 
actions are to generate the proper B-Sets. Since B-Sets contain only Possible Faces, the number of True 
Faces already containingthe given Edge is taken into account when fixing the minima and maxima defined 
by the B-Rules. Obviously, it is more rewarding to analyse True Edges than Possible Edges because the 
corresponding B-Rules are more constraining. 3.3. Vertices Analysis. Similarly, it is fruitful to analyse 
Vertices by applying B- Rule (4). It is certainly so to generate a B-Set for aTrue Vertex, but when a 
Vertex is only Possible, more than generating a B-Set by applying the B-Rule (4) which is rather "weak" 
for Possible Vertices, and waiting for it to be involved in a theorem-proving session, we would prefer 
to find out right away if it can be True. This is a relatively long process but it might significantly 
reduce the whole recognition time given that surplus Vertices are the source of all troubles. To estimate 
whether aPossible Vertex can be True or not is done as follows: Let S be the set of Possible Faces containing 
a Possible Vertex V. We want to determine the minimum and maximum number of Possible Faces of S that 
can be True from the knowledge we currently have about them, i.e.,the existing B-Sets containing them. 
If the minimum is equal to or greater than 3 then V is True and if the maximum is less than 3 then V 
is False. Also, if S is partitioned into disjoint sets,then the maximum number of its Faces that can 
be True is the sum of such maxima in each subset, and so is its minimum. Existing B-Sets containing subsets 
of Sare combined into disjoint subsets of S whose minima and maxima are computed from those B-Sets 
from which they are derived. If then the minimum is still less than 3 or the maximum more than 3, then 
V remains Possible. Finally, a Vertex can be eliminated in another type of situation, namely if it is 
situated between the Vertices of a True Edge.  3.4. Initializations. The first B-Sets. Some B-sets, 
the first ones chronologically defined, are not generated from B-rules but are derived from the problemstate 
such as at the end of the Faces identification processAll the Possible Faces projected on a given P-Face 
are identified at the same time and gathered in aset (cf. 2.1).If a P-Face has been drawn several times, 
it indicates that the user meant that several Faces are projected onto this P-Face (The user can draw 
a P-Face several times without doing so consecutively). To know the number of times a P-Face has been 
drawn is to know the number of Possible Faces projectedonto this P-Face that must be True*. To determine 
the number of True Faces in a set of Side faces is different. From the Sfde Face identification process 
and B-Rule (3), it follows than no more than one Side Face can contain a given Side Edge. 3.5.The Mini 
Theorem Prover If a Face belongs to several B-Sets it is possible, and even probable, that its existent@ 
will be determined. So, whenever a Face F is presenl in more than three B-Sets the theorem prover is 
run*. The B-sets become its axioms and the theorems to prove arc that ellher F IS True or F is False. 
The value True or False is given lo F end thir value prababfy implies values ol ofher Faces in fhe various 
fl-Sets. These values are carried over m other B-Sets and SO on until the theorem is either proved or 
refuted. A theorem is proved when no more Faces of the B-Sets constituting its domain can be assigned 
an existential value. In that case no concMon can be drawn because the fact that it is true in the context 
defined by the current B-sets does not imply its universality. On the other hand, if it is False in at 
least this context, it implies that it cannot be True. 4 theorem 1s refuted when the existential value 
assigned to a Face violates an axiom, namely when it brings the cardinal of a B-Set out of its range 
(see example on fig. 4). When a theorem 1s proved, which is not Min. Nb. at f osstble Faces Max. Nb.

0 The number three has been estimated to generally provide reasonable chances to lead the theorem prover 
to some result but there is nothing absolute &#38;out it. 3.6.Face Direction. The interesting property 
Of the Faces composing B-Sets formed by applying B-Rule (2) is no longer their existence but their direction. 
B-Sets. thus built contain Faces of unknown direction and their bounded subsets contain Faces of a given 
direction (specified so as to ensure the equilibrium dictated in instantiating B-Rule (2)). If the cardinal 
of such a B-Set equals that of its subset, then all its Faces will have the specified directton. 11 a 
newly oriented Face is Possible, then it is given a * presumed direction. We do not know yet if it is 
True er not but we know that if it is, then its direction will be as just specilied. Therefore, if later 
on, during a similar process, it IS assigned d presumed direction opposed to this one, it can be killed. 
-4-BODY 1DENTIFICATION Because of the general principle that a good solution state is likely to lead 
to a better solution state (without proof of convergence in our case though), the different processes 
of the recognition are applied in the order of their strength. When a Face is declared True, then it 
IS put in a stack SO that its Edges will get enalyzed. I1 is put at the top of the slack if its directhan 
is defined and at the bottom if not To slarl, a djrecjion is gjueh lo Lhc TIUE FJC~ which is the most 
connected to other True Fates, so that its own Edges and many other anes will bet a dIrection, If there 
is no True Face at the beginning, then the first True Face is given a direction. When it occurs that 
there are no more True Faces to analyse on the stack, several things can happen. If there is no more 
Possible Faces, then Faces are combined into a body and the recognition is achieved. If there are still 
some Possible Vertices, then they are analyssd in the way described in 3.2. If there are still some 
posrhble Faces, then they are analysed. When no new True Faces can possibly be generated, r.e. when the 
program remains blocked, then it requires the user 5 help by questioning the existence of a Possible 
Vertex. rhis is usually a relatively easy question 10 answer, but the user is free to rgnore it. Finally, 
if none of these attempts produce any Improvement, then the program asks for a third view in the case 
that only two were given or else states its failure to recognize the input. -5-MULTIPLE BODY INPUTS Multiple 
body inputs are also recognized by the program, although with less certainty. Diflerences between the 
two modes appear in the two main phases: Face identification and selection and Body identification. ln 
the former, they are not really essential and just loosen a l~tlle the efficiency of Face selection (ch\efIy 
by enlarging the renge of B-Sets cardinals). In the laiter, they debne Ihe real sperifjrily of the multiple 
body mode. Unfortunately, they also constltute the weakest part of the multiple body object recognition. 
The number bf alternatives for the Face adjacent to a given Face in a particular Body can be quite large 
(not reduced to a single possibility like in the single body mode) and the heuristics to choose it are 
not very powerful [6]. 107 -6- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND CONCLUSION. This program written in BLISS-10, 
is currently implemented on a PDP-10. It is in the process of being transferred to a PDP 11/20 and fully 
integrated into BDS. It has been tested on a few examples but still needs to be widely used in order 
to acquire some reliability. ACKNOWLEDGMENT [ owe special thanks to the members of the BDS team,especially

 CONTROLLING USER INTERACTION David J. Kasik Battelle Columbus Laboratories Columbus, Ohio 43201 1. 
INTRODUCTION The user of an interactiveapplication is inan anamolous position, especially if he isnot 
one of the elite class known as "computer bums". This mythical user isat the end of a process totally 
controlled by a computer and a program. His com­munications with the program may suffer greatly because 
of this total dependence. Control of communication in the batch environment ismuch more a one-way street. 
Here the user supplies the program data, and the batch program informs him if something has gone wrong 
by evict­ing his run from the machine. The user then con­sults available documentation (if it exists) 
or a computer expert (ifone exists) for help insolv­ing the problem. The communication between pro­gram 
and user is not critical in this environment; the user is expected to know what to do before he starts 
the run and can seek assistance outside of the computer.  The interactive environment, however, has 
the user totally at the mercy of the program for diagnostic and prompting information. Even soph­isticated 
graphics-oriented applications,which provide large amounts of useful information through pictures, may 
not adequately control the user's interaction. The user needs direction imposed on him to successfully 
solve his problem. At the same time, the system must provide flexi­bility, i.e., he must not be constrained 
to a single path of action that may only suit the code's implementor. No user's manual can capture a 
flow of this nature because of the inherently static nature of words on paper. Furthermore, paging back 
and forth ina manual to decipher what is to be done next destroys the spontaneity implicit in a successful 
interactive system. The user must be the main concern of the interac­tive system for it to be successful. 
With this goal inmind, Battelle-Columbus has developed a structured approach to controlling user interac­tion. 
The approach benefits the implementor as well as the user. Itplaces emphasis on design and checkout of 
interaction as the first, rather than the last, step in an interactive application. Permission to make

14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 2. ALTERNATIVES Indesigning a large interactive application for the 
U.S. Air Force ),Battelle-Columbusbecame acutely aware of the lack of tools for controlling interaction. 
Although many successful interactive application from budget planningL to forging die designN ) are available 
at Battelle, no coher­ent mechanism was present to attack the problem. Most of the systems were keyboard 
oriented and ranged insophistication from excellent software string crackers to FORTRAN READ statements. 
One of the early decisions made in the project was to orient the task toward the Control Data CYBER 
Graphics alV"). Terminal, a large screen refresh termin­To avoid the need of long type-ins, the lightpen 
was chosen to be the general input mech­anism. The user can control the program by a series of picks 
from a menu of messages on the screen. Because of the breadth of the application, we decided to develop 
a tool for generating menus automaticallybefore attacking the actual problem. Three approaches were 
examined and discarded before the actual mechanism of a tree was chosen. The problem that needed to be 
overcome was one of se­mantic rather than syntactic validation because a lightpen strike easily detects 
the exact wish of the user. The first possibility was to adapt the finite state table(5) (Fig. 1) to 
the task. The state table isparticularly effective inparsing appli­cations. This approach proved to be 
unsatisfac­tory because the user would be constrained to one path. The detection of alternatives once 
a path is started is difficult without special case test­ing. The table isalso difficult to construct 
initially for the same reason. Finally, the table has no convenient mechanism for retreating to a previous 
node without going back to the start of the testing procedure.  FIGURE 1. FINITE STATE TABLE (GRAPHICALPRESENTATION) 
 The second possibility, a key-word table, has the same problems as the finite state table: difficult 
 to detect alternatives, difficult in initial con­ struction, and no selective retreat. It is even less 
desirable because the one direction of con­ trol in the state table is not provided without special 
case testing. The third and least attractivemethod utilizes a series of IF tests that expand seemingly 
without bound. The interactive program controller may ultimately take more room than the working por­ 
tions of the program because the entire control­ ling mechanism has become a special case. All the previously 
described ills occur and are compounded. Changing one module may affect another module of the application, 
which may affect another, ad infinitum. The structure that overcomes all of these problems as well as 
offering some distinct advantages isa triply linked tree (Fig. 2). The tree explicitly links legal alternatives 
and offers a clear path back to the top, thus avoiding the main disadvan­tages of the state table. In 
implementing the "command tree", we have devised a generator and processor that are application free, 
thus making the tree usable by interactive application.  3. ADVANTAGES OF APPROACH The command tree 
concept offers distinctadvantages for both the interactive user and programmer. A large application can 
easily overwhelm an inter­ active user by being overflexible. The user may not know what direction to 
follow. Through the command tree, the user now receives: a knowledge of what he isexpected to do via 
prompting messages definitions of individual commands on request a historical record of prior choices 
  FIGURE 2. TRIPLY LINKED TREE . ability to skip levels up and down .confidence inunified program 
responses. The command tree offers the user assistance in his decision making in two ways. On a large 
scale, the user isconfronted by a series of choices in a menu. He may be required to interactwith the 
 picture in front of him before selecting again. Through the use of prompting messages, the user can 
be told what he isexpected to do next. While a prompting message can aid the user in his direction, 
he may need additional explanation about the actual meaning of a command. Through the use of the tree's 
help feature, the user can retrieve the definition of a command at any step. The tree thus aids the user 
inchoosing a path through the application and deciphering what particular commands mean. The user 
may also want to know how he reached a certain point inthe application. Because of the linkage in the 
tree, reconstructingthe path traced by the user is straightforward. The user can ask the system for 
an immediate playback of the actions he has taken. The above features aid a novice user. The exper­ienced 
user must also be considered in the design process for an interactiveapplication. He may know precisely 
what he wants to do without prompt­ ing messages or traversal of individual levels. The linkage in the 
tree and the setting of defaults within the application easily allows rapid tra­ versal. This tool isparticularly 
effective when the user has reached the end of a particular path and wishes to return to a much higher 
level. For example, he may have constructed a display and now wishes to zoom on the drawing. Through 
the skip feature, he can enter a picture modification section rapidly. Structuring a program's responses 
offers one final advantage for the user. As an application increases in size and complexity, numerous 
people will add sections of code. One continuing diffi­culty is that each individual programmer may impose 
his own "style" to interaction. By usino a single generator and driver, the same approach to interaction 
isprovided for all modules of the application. Both the novice and experienced user will know what to 
expect when new modules are added to the system. This helps the user imme­diately learn the features 
of a new module rather than anticipate a change in interaction mechanics. The programmer also benefits 
from the command tree. It simplifies his task by  allowing the structuring of interaction before coding 
begins  making the interaction steps easy to debug, update, and maintain  calling the interaction 
service routines and traversing the tree automaticallythrough a small, general driver.  Perhaps the 
most important single advantage of the command tree is to allow the programmerto con­struct interaction 
before programming begins. The programmer specifies each step in the interactive procedure explicitly, 
including prompting messages and help definition. This allows a top-down approach to the actual programming 
task. By using this approach, subtasks can be assigned without concern about the interactive flow. This 
approach makes the construction of interaction most impor­tant in the design rather than the construction 
of a particular subtask. Construction of the menus requires no more than preparation of a data file. 
The entire sequence can be set up and tested without the generation of application code. Inthis manner, 
the programmer can insure that the interaction works as designed before getting bogged down in code implementation. 
Similarly, pieces of large trees can be split out and exercized in parallel. Updates and changes to the 
menus can be made to the data file, avoiding costly recompilations and testing of newly developed code. 
Maintenance is also simpli­fied. The data file is in an easy to read format and contains enough information 
to be self­documenting. A program to traverse the resultant tree provides a rapid summary of the entire 
inter­action mechanism. In short, the interaction is totally centralized for an entire application. 
A general driver is provided to handle all types of lightpen picks and type-ins. After receiving a user 
input, the driver branches to the program­mer's processing subroutine. The programmer specifies the action 
to be taken next in travers­ing the command tree (go down n levels, go up n levels, stay on this level). 
If an error occurs, the processing subroutine can override the tra­verse action. For example, the user 
may make an error ina type-in. The processing subroutine can override the requested action, display an 
appropriate error message, and force the user to correct the bad values. The driver isalso com­pact, 
allowing more space for the programmer's own code.  4. IMPLEMENTATION The command tree is currently 
operational on Battelle's CDC 6400 computer system operating under SCOPE 3.4.x. It is a FORTRAN based 
system and consists of two modules. An overview of the system is given in Fig. 3. The generation phase 
isa stand-alone program. It communicates the programmer's command tree to the driver through a random-accessdisk 
file and an internally generated machine language program. The driver uses these two pieces to control 
the user's interaction and automatically branch to the programmer's processing subroutines. The command 
tree generator formats an interaction description for the driver. The programmerneed only supply the 
description as a free-format data file. The data file is structured only by a level specification for 
each command. As the level num­ber increases, the depth into the tree increases. An example of a user 
formatted data file isgiven in Fig. 4.  FIGURE 3. COMMAND FLOW 15, N = "MODIFY PICTURE", A = 2, T =

scheme is a generalization of the method described by Knuth.(7) The level linkage is circular rather 
than one-way. The generator also provides one assembly language routine containing a linkage table to 
all of the subroutines specified in the data file. This routine is to be inserted with the programmer's 
own subroutines. The linked data file is then processed as the con-troller of the application's subprograms. 
The driver first places each name comprising the menu on the screen. Picks from another part of the screen 
can be queued before a menu item is picked. The menu name pick acts as the trigger for pro-cessing the 
queue and the driver calls the speci-fied subroutine. After returning from theroutine, the tree proceeds 
to the next specified level. The driver consumes less than 400 decimal words of core and centralizes 
all interaction processing in one routine. Core requirements are low because of use of the random disk 
file. 5. EVALUATION OF RESULTS The command tree is fully operational in both of its phases. It is currently 
the basis for a large application involving finite element model analy-sis being developed at Battelle. 
The net result of this effort has been excellent. The implement-ation time has been much less than expected 
be-cause of the top-down approach to programming. The command tree was structured and given to engineers 
for evaluation well before actual coding began. Although only the menus appeared on the screen, the engineers 
could grasp how the flow of the application would progress and their comments helped refine the menus 
greatly. The concept has been readily adopted and applied by others. Structuring a user's input through 
a tree gives implementors much more flexibility than the conventional approach. This is particularly 
true of non-computer oriented engineers, who most often code their interaction as a series of cum-bersome 
keyboard inputs even when working at a refresh-type terminal. The program for command tree generation 
is readily transferrable to other devices. The tree is gen-erated independently of the mode of user input. 
It could be adapted easily to a total keyboard in-put environment through a re-written driver. The checking 
of input commands is greatly simplified because legal commands are constrained to a subset automatically 
by the tree. Through another small modification, the experienced user could easily queue typed-in commands 
for automatic processing by the system. The concept of the command tree provides a useful tool in controlling 
user interaction. It has proved itself advantageous for both the user and implementor of interactive 
applications. REFERENCES Cl] This research is sponsored through Air Force Contract No. F336 1 5-75-C-3096.

 The Enhanced-InputTerminal project isdirected at providing major new degrees of freedom for touch-type 
computer input, especially for on-line use of interactive computer systems. The terminal comprises an 
integrated system of hardware and software. While various choices are  available for the actual input 
and output devices, the present prototype utilizes video display for both devices and a "cross-wire", 
touch-sensitive input panel. The EITS allows an "author" to define an essentially infinite set of symbols, 
and an infinite variety of "keyboard" formats. Chord inputs (i.e., simultaneous, multiple-"key" combinations) 
are also supported. Symbols can be defined interms of dot matrices, generalized graphics, symbol strings, 
and functional oper­ ations.  Inspite of the complete generality afforded, the integrated system develops 
a standard­ type of binary-bit-coded input stream, in which the individual symbols are uniquely and canonically 
represented, and which is amenable to all of the usual "text-file" operations, such as character manipulation, 
editing, transmission and re-display. 1. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSREGARDING USER INPUT TERMINALS Over 
the past decade, there has been a slow evo­ lution towards greater sophistication inmass­ produced computer 
terminals, yielding more favorable combinations of various benefits: * lower cost * higher speed 
* local editing  * quieter operation  * graphics display * limited choice of symbol sets  Some of 
these, of course, have been achieved at the expense of local hard copy, by using a video­display, storage-CRT 
or plasma panel without a copy device. Nonetheless, significant limitations remain, particularly regarding 
user input. 2. THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF STANDARD INPUT TERMINALS 2.1 LIMITED SYMBOL SET The first 
and most noticeable limitation is in the small number of standard input symbols. The primary means of 
communication from the user to the computer is keyboard input of alphanumeric symbols. Unfortunately,that 
communication is often hampered by being forced within the con­fines of a limited number of symbols, 
usually a  116 subset of the USASCII 1968 standard set* of 95 printable characters. The limitation 
on the number of symbols available for a user task re­ sults from the nature of existing terminal/ 
keyboard devices and of their supporting input/ output software, both of which are based on the premise 
that a fixed and relatively small number  of symbols will suffice. As terminal/keyboards have evolved 
from typewriters, this concept has no doubt seemed a reasonable one, with each sug­ gested deviation 
from standardness being subjected to its proper scrutiny.** Operationally, this limitation may not 
have seemed unduly restrictive inmany quarters. Indeed, the concept of defining the available symbols, 
or groups of symbols, to have special meanings under particular circumstances has allowed the standard 
 symbol set to do more than double duty.Thus.+  and ** and .P.have all three been used to mean "raise 
to the power"; "0 backspace -" may mean arb f(x)"; and "A.SUB.i+j"may mean "Ai+j". In "the greek letter 
theta"; "INT(a,b,f,x)" may mean an  environment inwhich much of the serious communica­tion from the 
user to the computer is still *ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstu = vwxyz 0123456789!"#$%&#38;' 
()*+,-./:; {}~ **It would appear, however, that even though type­writers were used as the base for design, 
in­adequate weight was given to the prevalence of special symbol and font-style devices, and to the skill 
with which most typists handle the carriage roll for off-line placement. referred to as "writing code" 
such conventions are readily accepted. And yet, there are signs that the situation is increasingly less 
satisfactory, particularly as the user group becomes less dom­ inated by computer professionals and demi­ 
professionals. Consider, for instance, a student of physics,  using a computerized tutorial on the 
wave equation [1,2] and faced with a question that requires a mathematical response which would have 
the following appearance innormal notation:  With a standard terminal, and following rules given in 
the tutorial referred to, he will have to type in something like:  It isworth emphasizing that the 
notation exhib­ited isderived from a reasonably well-conceived scheme which tends to minimize the potential 
awk­ wardness. Moreover, it takes advantage of the fact that the response analyzer in the system being 
used [3] handles overstrike (multiple stroke) symbols; otherwise itwould have been necessary to spell 
out the Greek letters:  These alternate forms are not desirable in in­structional applications because 
they require the student to learn extraneous codes and because they stress notational schemes different 
from those used in the published literature and in textbooks. They are also troublesome because the particular 
notational conventions are relatively arbitrary; the convention adopted by one author islikely to be 
different from his colleagues' and different from the conventions used inalgorithmic program­ming languages, 
such as Fortran, Cobol, MAD, etc. These languages, inturn, use conventions which differ from one to another. 
Thus, the use of a limited, standard symbol set (which does not in­clude the natural symbols (or positioning) 
of particular applications paradoxically tends to lead to a diversity rather than a uniformity notation. 
This isdistracting and confusing, particularly in an educational situation. Another interesting type 
of example, which stresses the differences between display and input capabilities, can be drawn from 
a report on a sophisticated,multi-charactercathode-ray­ type display terminal developed at the MIT Electronic 
Systems Laboratory, for use in libraries, as part of the Intrex project [4]. The partial line of text 
illustrated below (in quotes) represents a significant step beyond the display capability of run-of-the-mill 
terminals. The use of superscripts and subscripts and of non­ standard symbols allows the chemical formula 
in the line to be represented on the display in its standard form [5]:  117 The same report also explains 
how that information must be input:  The augmented display capability illustrated above iscertainly 
valuable in its own right. However there is less advantage in its use if the user must train himself 
to use the different inputting code. It is perhaps surprising that the latter form isas readable as 
it is; for a person un­ familiar with chemistry itmight even be more readable than the correctly displayed 
form. As an input scheme for "chemists", however, spelling out the nonstandard symbols and format in 
English­like text is at best a tedious and error-prone option. Other schemes, deviating further and 
further from the standard symbol set, have been developed in response to the continuing pressure for 
more and different input symbols. One approach has been to replace the entire standard keyboard symbol 
set with another one, specially designed for a spe­ cific application. Perhaps the best known example 
of this is an APL terminal, for which the keyboard labels and type head are changed to provide a unique 
set of symbols, the symbol set of the APL programming language [6]. Taking this one step further, manufacturers 
now offer dual terminals of the cathode-ray or storage-tube-type,which the user may switch fairly conveniently 
between standard and APL, using one or the other at any time [7]. Another approach has been to add 
more keys to the keyboard. Some of the extra keys may be assigned high-level operational meaning, such 
as log x, ex or display, a scheme which provides a convenient shorthand in the limited context of a 
particular application [8]. Experimental terminals for engineering applications have been developed with 
as many as 250 "side" keys, alongside the standard keyboard [9]. For the extra keys, standard con­ventions 
are discarded; symbol codes, transmis­sion codes, and system input/output software routines. Nonetheless, 
such keyboards are still mainly limited to the fixed, though larger, symbol set which happens to be included. 
An additional disadvantage to this, as a general approach is simply the distraction that ispresented 
by so formidablean array of keys, only a fraction of which are likely to be used in any brief period 
of time. A related scheme has been to assign multiple sets of meanings to a fixed number of keys. This 
is an extension of the ordinary "shift" concept which allows each key to represent two different symbols, 
depending on whether the shift key is depressed or not. With multiple meanings, the user may be required 
to type a special code -­e.g., LEVEL III --to indicate that he desires to switch to a particularset of 
meanings for the keys. It is difficult to provide many readable labels per key, however, so the basic 
limitation remains. Thus, for example, inthe Culler-Fried "On-Line Computer System" for numerical analysis,the 
designers have used both the level-change scheme and a real enlargement of the keyboard to about twice 
the standard number of keys to satisfy the requirements of that application alone [10]. Also, in that 
particular system (among others) the user isallowed to assign personal meanings to particular keys at 
certain levels. This isa use­ful capability, but limited by the need for the user to memorize those assignments 
himself, since the key labels do not change. An interesting attempt to provide a multiplicity of key 
labels for a multi-"shift"-levelscheme has been made by the Philco Houston Operations of the Philco-Ford 
Corporation [11]. Their device con­sists of a "keyboard" comprising two 4 x 4 arrays of push bottons 
and an (exchangeable)ten page "book" of plastic sheet label overlays which have holes through which the 
buttons can protrude. The book spline locks into the center of the keyboard (between the two separate 
4 x 4 button arrays). When the book isopen to a given pair of pages the overlays provide the key labels. 
Mechanical cams attached to the book spline and to the in­dividual pages actuate switches under the keyboard 
to identify the particular book pad pages select­ed. Ina related but more recent approach, K. Knowlton 
of the Bell Telephone Laboratories has assembled a device inwhich key labels are projected onto a mechanical-key 
keyboard, while the use of partially-silveredmirrors allows the user to see his hands, the keys, and 
the labels -all simul­taneously [12]. Although this sounds ghost-like in description, the device issaid 
to be easy to use. Another approach, used with CRT and other display terminals, has been to generate 
"soft-copy" input areas, in which special symbols or function names are displayed on a reserved section 
of the CRT screen and selected by pointing at them with a light-pen, or by moving a cursor controlled 
by a "joy-stick" or trackball, or by interrupting a light beam inan array, or by a similar tech­nique 
[13]. The previously mentioned MIT Project-Intrex BRISC terminal extended this idea by dis­playing variable 
labels to identify a set of extra push buttons mounted along the bottom of the CRT screen. "Soft-copy" 
input modes implemented on the display inthese various ways can provide an additional richness and flexibility 
in the input symbol set but are generally slower to work with than separate keyboards and are often not 
suitable for routine input. They are thus used incombina­tion with a standard keyboard, which results 
in the user having to transfer back and forth from one type of input device to the other --he must drop 
the light pen to type, for example, and vice versa. More importantly, information input in that fashion 
isoften handled ina manner that is not homogeneous with normal input. That is,with normal input-handlingsoftware 
a key push is sim­ply converted into a binary-bitcode, unique to the particular symbol selected, and 
appended --if appropriate --to a symbol string input-stream. Such a string is subsequently amenable to 
the usual range of "character-handling"operations and, of course, itcan be edited later or redis­played. 
In contrast, with input schemes like those referred to immediately above, the control­ling software routine 
is likely to be a specialized one, designed inconjunction with the specific picture then being displayed, 
and direct­ ly carrying out one action or another, depending on the numerical x and y values of the 
screen locations selected. Another type of effort towards achieving a larger input set is seen in the 
continuing work of com­mittees assigned the task of defining standard character codes [14]. In spite 
of serious initial attempts to standardize on a code requiring only 6 bits per symbol (64 characters 
in all) in the early 1960's, this was rejected as impossible by 1963. The first "standard" 7 bit code 
was ap­proved in1963 (ASCII; x3.4-1963). Of the 128 possible symbols, 32 were reserved for control functions 
and 28 were left unassigned; in partic­ular, the lower case alphabet was not specifically included. By 
1968, however, the functions of all of the controls had been decided and the printable symbols were all 
specified; the latter included the lower case alphabet (ASCII; 3.4-1968). At the present time the standards 
arbiters seem poised to make another factor-of-two jump, to an 8-bit code. Infact, itmay be impossible 
to achieve universal acceptance at that level. For example, thirty-two additional control functions have 
been proposed for alphanumeric display terminals alone (of which 21 would be single-character controls). 
A group considering only library requirements has listed 55 new printable symbols that they would like 
in an expanded set. The Russians, with their Cyril­lic alphabet, and the Japanese, Koreans and Chinese, 
of course, have their individual require­ments for the extra symbols that might be associ­ated with the 
8-th bit. We have already mentioned APL, a popular programming language, which re­quires thirty unusual 
symbols itself. Ifone con­siders the possibility of adding standard and common mathematical symbols, 
another list comes forth. There are also advocates for assigning mathematical operator status to single-key 
codes (e.g., ex, sin x); such features are now commonly available on inexpensive hand-calcula­tors, and 
therefore likely to be taken for granted by the incoming generation of users. Itdoes not appear, therefore, 
that extending the standard code to 8 bits will satisfy all of the obvious needs in this regard, let 
alone more exotic suggestions --such as musical notes, circuit element symbols and the like. 2.2 FIXED 
FORMAT A second basic type of flaw in the usual input de­vice is the lack of format flexibility. The 
user faces a fixed key layout, usually with fixed key labels; an instrument based on a design for put­ting 
English prose onto paper. As ithappens, the standard symbol layout used is not ideally suited even for 
that purpose, but that quantitative de­tail is almost irrelevant inthe present context. It is important, 
however, to consider the pos­sibility that touch-input communication to a com­puter may be qualitativelyenhanced 
through the use of formats more closely related to the specif­ic interactions underway. Two examples 
are dis­cussed below to illustrate the need. Often, experimenters who use the interactive capa­bility 
of computers in special ways (in such fields as cognition, psychology and computer science)  118 find 
itnecessary to constuct special input de­ vices. Often, however, their requirements could be satisfied 
by a more flexible touch-input "key­ board" device. We note, for instance, the recent reporting of computer-controlledexperiments 
on concept formation by E.A. Jerome of the National Institute of Mental Health [15]. The type of experiment 
being undertaken and the subject's input needs may be sensed from the following sample communications 
from the computer to the subject: Now please press all of the black buttons, one at a time. Then press 
 the button marked SOLUTION. Fine! That was what we call a word. Itwas the word "black." A word consists 
of eight buttons all of which have some dimension in common. Now please send me the word "square". 
 The keyboard constructed for these experiments appears to consist of about 19 buttons, arranged ina 
square array of 16, plus three which have special functions. In the array of sixteen, some of the keys 
have symbols printed on them, a square or a circle, large or small, solid or just out­ lined. One of 
the special buttons is printed "TELL ME", another "SOLUTION". Itseems clear that no degree of clever 
"code-convention defini­tion" will allow the usual keyboard to function in place of the special input 
device for this application. At the same time, given the sophis­tication of the computers now being used, 
it is unfortunate that readily-available input-output equipment isnot adequate for even such simple 
demands. As a second example of free-formattingadvantages, consider a keyboard image designed for use 
by children, consisting of figure outlines, as sche­matically illustrated in fig. 1.* A number of spots 
within each outline would be "live", and each would be indicated by a bright spot. All of the "points" 
within an outline would be assigned to the identical "symbol". That is,the points within the "fish" 
outline (the "fish" key) would all be assigned to one symbol and the points within the "man" outline 
(the "man" key) would be assigned to another symbol. The first symbol might have the visual representation: 
FISH, and the other the representation: MAN. Thus, if the student pressed any of the points within the 
fish outline, the symbol FISH would be echoed­back to the display screen, and the symbol MAN ifa point 
inside the other outline were pressed. Each of those two symbols would also be associated with a single 
binary bit code which would repre­sent it inany "text" file. That is, FISH might be coded and stored 
as 101101101 and MAN as 110011011. Within the set of keyboard images   there might also be additional, 
but different keyboards from which the same symbols could be referenced. Thus, for example, there might 
be a keyboard with ordinary-looking key outlines, on which certain keys were associated with those same 
symbols (e.g., the visual representation FISH and the code 101101101) but labeled with the symbol itself 
(i.e., FISH). The latter keyboard might be used, for instance, by a teacher to write an in­ teractive 
program with which students would use the example "outline" pictorial keyboard, among others. Such 
a keyboard might also be used by the students themselves after they had learned to read the particularwords. 
 2.3 CONTEXT INDEPENDENCE  As a third major flaw regarding standard, all­purpose keyboards, we suggest 
that they are det­rimental to the efficiency of human-computer interaction, especially inconsideration 
of errors and the fallibility of human memory. Inpartic­ular, we believe that it is not desirable to 
always present the user with a single keyboard through which he can send any communication which is,which 
has ever been, and which might ever be a valid statement. Such a keyboard does not pro­vide any clues 
as to what input ismeaningful at a given instant ina given process, although the computer software isoften 
very "knowledgeable" and sensitive about what is legitimateand what is not. At the same time, the very 
generality of the standard keyboard provides unlimited opportunity for error. It ismore desirable to 
present "current context keyboards" wherever the interaction affords the opportunity. That is,inmany 
instances the key­board presented at a given moment can be very specific, designed not simply for a given 
task, but even for a specific portion of that task. 119 This implies, of course, that keyboards need 
to be rapidly and dynamically variable, keeping pace with the user's activity; keeping pace with his 
path through the levels of the interaction. In this type of framework, the communication effi­ciency 
can be raised considerably, because: * each key press can have a relatively macroscopic effect, and 
 * the error probability will be lower, due to the existence of a smaller choice of simultaneous options 
and the fact that the keyboards can be either self-explanatoryor include user instructions.   Inaddition, 
dynamic keyboards can include user­defined key labels with the corresponding benefit that derives from 
the user being able to refer with a single key-push to objects of his own cre­ation, by names of his 
own choice. As an example of this type of keyboard utilization we consider possible modes of use for 
a set of programs designed for drawing crystal and molec­ular structure models on a terminal display 
in perspective or as stereo pairs [16]. Inusing the model-drawingprograms, the user can define models 
and viewing orientations (views) of his choice. The models are described interms of 1. three basic vectors, 
A1, A2, and A3, which specify the desired coordinate space and which are themselves defined interms of 
the orthogonal x, y, z coordinates.  2. any number of atoms, specified by:  a) their location, interms 
of three relative distances, one along each of the basic vectors (relative distances called u, v, and 
w, respectively) b) their size, given either by a value for the atomic radius or by an atom-type identifier 
(which is tied to a radius value) c) an identification number, which can be included inthe drawing. 
 3. any number of "bond" lines, each drawn between any pair of atoms in the model.  The views are specified 
in terms of 1. a point in the model which is to be the center of the view.  2. the viewer's eye point, 
specified in terms of one of the following:  a) a point in space inAl, A2, A3 coordinates b) a point 
in space in r, 0, coordinates, or c) a point in space given by distance, r, from the view center and 
a direction, in terms of Miller index crystal notation (h, k, 1). 3. a choice of stereo or simple per­spective 
pictures.  The individual models and views are automatically numbered and can optionally be assigned 
unique names when they are created. The user can request drawings of particular views of particular models. 
The display screen may be divided among one, two, or four perspective drawings, or among one or two stereo-pairs. 
 To envision one possible form for a "dynamic key­ board" implementation,we consider an interaction comprising 
three different kinds of operations: * draw a particular view of a particular model  * describe a model 
 * describe a view   We can define a special keyboard image for each stage of the interaction. The 
software (or the user) will select among the keyboards as required; then, the user will see keyboards 
that pertain to his immediate situation. The sketches infigs. 2 and 3 are schematic drawings for two 
keyboards in this scheme. The first isfor the "primary" level keyboard -used to request specific drawings 
on the display screen, or to initiate other actions, such as specifying a new type of view. The second 
is for the "describe a model" keyboard. Other keyboards for the process would no doubt include one to 
describe a view and one -with a simple set of alphanumeric characters -to name the models and views. 
Inthe two examples shown the following conventions have been used:  FIGURE 2. STAGE ONE KEYBOARD: REQUEST 
A MODEL DRAWING OR START A DESCRIPTION. 120 * The live (touchable) points on the keyboards are usually 
marked by the * symbol, sometimes by the # symbol and, in the case of the digits, by the digit symbols 
themselves. Touching the indicated points is equivalent to depressing the associated "key". * Lines 
of input are held and can be edited until a "send" key is pushed. In the present example the relevant 
keys are labeled "INPUT LINE VERIFIED." * Dynamically created portions of the keyboard are shown in 
itallics. In the present example these are the "name" labels attached by the cur-rent user to the model 
and view keys numbered 1 to 3 and 1 to 4, respect-ively. (We can assume that the other available model 
and view numbers have not yet been used.)  FOR A NEW MODEL, DEFINE THE THREE BASIC VECTORS FIRST. NUMERICAL

KEYBOARD: OESCRISE A MODEL. There is no need to dwell here in further detail on the use of the model 
drawing programs. We think it is clear, however, that keyboards of the sort illustrated can be reasonably 
self-explanatory. We believe that a person with some knowledge of the explicit task (e.g., crys-tallography 
or molecular structure) can quickly become adept in the dynamic keyboard framework, with relatively little 
auxiliary information. By contrast, the manual accompanying the batch processing form of the programs 
runs to about 20 pages. 3. FEATURES DESIRED FOR A COMPUTER INPUT FACILITY In the foregoing discussion 
in section 2, we have argued foran input terminal with three major characteristics which are now rarely, 
if ever, found in COnjUnCtion. Here we specify those three more succinctly and concretely. 3.1 A symbol 
set which is author-definable and virtually unlimited in terms of the number of symbols or the visual 
aspect of the symbols.  3.2 Keyboards whose formats are essentially com- pletely arbitrary, allowing 
all possibilities ranging from the standard key layout of a type-writer, to drawings like those in fig. 
1, to "templates" like those in figs. 2 and 3. 3.3 Keyboards which can be dynamically switched, keeping 
pace with the user's path through an in-teraction, being specifically relevant to the then current aspect 
of the task. Having listed these, it is important to stress that they should not be achieved at the expense 
of the most fundamental notion of all -that in-putting to a computer should generate a sensible input-stream. 
3.4 The input actions should generate a binary-coded input stream which is explicitly meaningful in terms 
of the defined symbol set, and which has the attributes of an ordinary text file. Input should be amenable 
to the usual operations that one applies to text files (or symbol strings), such as: * character-handling 
operations (e.g., substring, length, concatenate)  * string comparison (e.g., for response analysis 
and interpretation)  * editing  * outputting (including display format control) 3.5 Input should be 
canonicalized, so that a given symbol is always represented identically internally, regardless of the 
keyboard-image used to input it -of those keyboards associated with a given process.* These are the fundamental 
features. In addition, there are a number of other attributes for a terminal system that are necessary 
or desirable for effective and convenient use. First, regarding the general framework. 3.6 The system 
should include the concept of "working-sets" (comprising symbols and related keyboard-images) associated 
with specific types of processes. This feature means that a given process does not have to be "aware 
of" all the symbols which have ever been defined and allows more efficient internal operation, in terms 
of both time and storage. It does not follow, how-ever, that every end-user will have a personal working-set 
for every different job. On the contrary, a single relatively small symbol set * I.e., of those keyboards 
associated with a given "working-symbol-set". consisting of the ASCII characters, the Greek alphabet, 
mathematical symbols and vector nota­ tions may serve many applications in mathematics, physics and 
chemistry, for example. On the other hand, we do believe that as the value of context­ related keyboard-images 
becomes more widely per­ ceived, a close -even symbiotic -relationship will develop between the specific 
user-processes and the provided working-sets. Nonetheless, incertain environments itmay be desired 
that every author and every end-user use the same working-symbol-set,the accumulation of everything ever 
used. Therefore ..... 3.7 The system software should be designed so that it is capable of handling very 
large working sets. Second, there are a number of issues relating to the specification,the appearance 
and the function of symbols and keyboard-images. 3.8 There should be a convenient language for authors 
to define a working-set. This language must be defined such that it can be used through a standard terminal, 
but the most convenient mechanism will most likely be the enhanced-input terminal, itself. 3.9 Symbols 
should include, ingeneral, both visual aspects and local operational aspects. 3.10 The outlines of "keys" 
on a keyboard-image should be of any shape or size and should be able to encompass any number of live, 
touchable points. 3.11 The visual aspects of symbols, subsymbols, live-pointmarkers, key outlines, key 
labels, and keyboard legends should be definable in terms of dot matrices (of arbitrary size), symbol 
strings, subsymbols, and generalized graphics (including graphical "functions"). 3.12 The visual aspects 
of symbols should not necessarily be the same as the label on an associated key, so that one can be simply 
a "token" for the other. 3.13 The standard ASCII set should be part, and the same part, of all working-symbol-sets. 
This saves the trouble of specifically includ­ing iteach time and also makes itfeasible to exchange ASCII-only 
files with standard devices. 3.14 The coding scheme adopted for internal storage should be such that 
ASCII-only files can be handled by standard software or by the enhanced-terminal software -regardless 
of the source. 3.15 Itshould be possible to pre-define subsets of symbols (e.g., the Cyrillic alphabet, 
mathemat­ical symbols, musical notes, etc.) and include them inthe definition of various working-sets 
by simple file-reference. 3.16 When keyboard-imageschange, the switch needs to occur rapidly; certainly 
in less than a second. 3.17 The keyboard should have some pressure-feel to the fingers but an audible 
signal is probably more critical [17]. 3.18 The spatial resolution of the potentially live, touchable 
points should be sufficiently fine to allow freedom inthe design of keyboard­image formats. Something 
of the order of finger­width spacing seems adequate. 3.19 The keyboard electronics needs to be sensi­tive 
to "key bounce," of course. The system should also allow shift-key type of operation (with any "key" 
having the "shift" property), and it should permit finger-rolling,that is, "make­before-break" typing. 
 3.20 The system should include a chord mode, in which a number of keys can be touched simulta­neously 
and each particular combination repre­sents a specific symbol. 3.21 During input the system should "echo 
back" each symbol immediately, but -optionally -hold each line for correction, ifdesired, until it receives 
a terminator symbol. 3.22 In conjunction with the last point, the execution of "unerasable"operational 
aspects of symbols should be delayed during "echo-back" until after the line is verified and transmitted. 
3.23 The visual and local operational aspects of symbols should be exactly the same when received by 
the terminal for output as when received on input. 3.24 It should be feasible to obtain local hard­copy 
when necessary, however non-standard the visual appearance of the symbols on the output displays might 
be. 3.25 Itshould be feasible to "roll" the displayed output backwards as well as forwards to allow 
re­call of previously displayed material as well as continuously scrolled output instead of "page­flipping." 
 4. IMPLEMENTATION  We have, in fact, implemented a hardware/software terminal system embodying the 
features described in the foregoing section. It isan integrated system. Itcan serve as a remote terminal 
for a large time-sharing system, a stand-alone terminal/ computer combination, or as part of a distributed 
system with local input and processing as well as remote computation and data. 4.1 The hardware for 
the present prototype is comprised of three main components: 4.1.1 A Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 
11/40 computer [18]. This device, which ismore power­ful than isneeded for the terminal-only applica­tion, 
provides the major portion of the needed processing for the terminal as well as the "library" storage 
media and the storage access mechanisms. The software to implement, i.e. to "compile", the terminal author 
language as well as many of the keyboard and output display 122 More detailed descriptions of the implementation 
 computational and logical operations is handled and of the author language considerations will be 
by the 11/40 processor, programmed inassembly published later. language. 4.1.2 Two video monitors 
with solid-state, page­refresh memories and specialized circuitry for memory control and for video readout 
and signal generation [19]. One of these monitors serves the normal display function of a terminal; the 
other isthe basis for the dynamic keyboard. 4.1.3 A keyboard overlay with associated logic control circuitry 
and two-way interfacing to the 11/40. This overlay is essentially transparent and allows the displayed 
keyboard to be seen clearly beneath it. A matrix of crossed wires in the overlay inconjunction with scanning 
elec­tronics allows the surface to be "touch-sensitive" at a large number of points -approximately 600 
in the present version. 4.1.4 Additional hardware factors As the system currently stands, it can be 
readily augmented with additional display and overlay hardware to serve as an eight-terminal complex, 
each with two "display" units. As regards each of the three main hardware compo­nents, itshould be noted 
that the system can in principle utilize a wide range of alternate de­vices. To use the displays as an 
example, we can mention that storage-type CRT's [20], disk-re­freshed video, plasma discharge panels 
[21] can serve (although some of these may restrain the keyboard switching rates), as can devices which 
use partially or fully coated mirrors to super­impose images, as well as devices which project keyboard 
images pre-recorded on film (although the latter scheme, of course, is limited to images which are 
not varied inthe course of an interaction). A schematic diagram of the hardware configura­tion is shown 
infig. 4. 4.2 The software can be thought of in terms of two main components. 4.2.1 The compiler for 
the author language ­which iscalled the Terminal Definition Language. Inthis language, the author writes 
a "terminal definition file" (TDF); the most direct means is via the standard on-line editor of the 11/40 
operating system itself. The compiler converts the TDF into a set of highly-coded tables, con­taining 
the descriptions of the symbols and keyboard-images inthe working set. 4.2.2 The terminal operating system, 
that is, the driver. The driver programs implement the actuality of the terminal, accepting input from 
the overlay circuitry, echoing-back, drawing graphics, displaying images, retrieving and writing data 
to and from disk and display memories, converting input to coded streams for transmission, etc., etc. 
We note again, in this regard, that the functional behavior of the terminal isquite open­ended since 
any symbol can directly invoke any assembly language subroutinewhich can be handled by the local processor.

Michigan The social science computing environment and the implications of this for the developers of 
computer graphics is described. Graphic software developed for social scientists at the University of 
Michigan is illustrated. MULTIGROUP is used to generate displays in the process of data analysis. GRAPH 
is used to report results to others. A graphical editor is employed to customize displays. 1. INTRODUCTION 
 Social scientists are a large group of potential users of computer graphics. They make heavy use of 
computers in both research and teaching. When they use computers they are accustomed to sophisticated 
software and unsophisticateddevices. They rarely write special purpose programs and only a small subset 
use special hardware. Instead, they rely on high quality, multipurpose-softwarepackages of canned programs. 
These and other characteristicshave implications for the design of graphics software and hardware. These 
potential users will expect graphic software to be easy to use, powerful, inexpensive and device independent. 
If computer graphics evolves in these directions social scientistswill become major consumers. Computer 
graphics can aid the social scientist who is involved in data analysis in two distinct ways. First, computer 
graphic displays can be used after the research process to communicate research results to others in 
publications, in presentations and in teaching. This use requires that graphs be clearly labelled and 
adjustable in format. Second, computer graphics can be used during the researchprocess to communicate 
results to the primary researcher. This can be accomplished by embedding the graphics within data analysis 
software. This use requires that the graphics be obtained easily in addition to the traditional printout 
of results; ease of use is more important than flexibility of format or elegance of labelling. *This 
research was funded in part through a grant by the National Science Foundation to the Institute for 
Social Research, NSFGI 29904. The software described in this paper was developed as a joint project 
by the Statistical Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan and the Computer Support Group 
at the Center for Political Studies. The people responsible for design and implementationwere Sylvia 
Barge, Daniel Fox, Richard Herstein, Tom Hibbs, Gregory Marks, Neal Oden and Edward Schneider. We 
have developed graphic software to satisfy the perceived basic needs and expectations of the social scientists 
and which have been well received and utilized at the University of Michigan. It is embedded in the interactive 
statistical system, MIDAS,[1] and appears as a stand alone interactive prompter, GRAPH.[2] In the future 
this software may be available more generally over a national computer network. Our graphic software 
includes a set of modules which correspond to the visual components of a display, such as an axis with 
tic marks and labels or a legend. This modularity provides extensibility of the set of available displays 
with minimal effort. Our software in turn employs the University of Michigan Integrated Graphics library 
[3] to define a visual component as a set of device-independent lines or text strings. The IntegratedGraphics 
routines handle all graphic device communicationsincluding that for storage tube terminals and the CalComp 
ploter. We are not attempting in this paper to describe the internal design of the software we have 
produced. Our purpose is to describe the social science com­ puting environment and the external form 
of the graphic software designed both to fit that environ­ment and to introduce social scientists to 
computer graphics.  2. THE SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT Our development work has focused 
on that group of social scientists involved in data analysis. We include in this group those who do primary 
and secondary research, as well as those who consume this research or utilize it in teaching. The data 
 are usually individualopinion surveys or aggregate statistics such as census data. These are large 
 data sets which often contain 1,500 to 2,000 cases with 10 to 15 card images per case. While consumers 
of data-analysis-orientedsocial science need have no knowledge of computers, pro­ ducers are of necessity 
users of computers. How­ ever, very few of these users know any programming language and instead of writing 
special purpose programs, they tend to use packages of canned programs. The most common packages are 
SPSS,[4] OSIRIS,[5] and BMD[6]. Local packages are often the most frequent choice at specific locations 
such as MIDAS at the University of Michigan. In general these systems provide subprograms for data manage­ment 
and analysis. These are invoked as needed using keyworded setups with the package minimizing the user's 
need to know about the operating system. The printout of a run using one of these packages can be anywhere 
from one page to several hundred. Often the output of the analysis is a series of numbers which could 
easily be summarized in a graphic form. This graphic form would be more quickly comprehended than the 
series of numbers in the printout. Most data analysis output falls under one of three general categories: 
a cross tabulation, a correlation matrix, or regression coefficients. Cross tabulation can easily be 
represented graphically by line graphs, bar charts, pie charts etc.[7] Correlation matrices can be represented 
graphically following further data reduction with techniques such as factor analysis.[8] Regressions 
can be represented by scatterplots with line(s) through them.[9] Virtually any set of statistics can 
be represented by a meaningful line graph.[10] Statistics which are normalized can be represented by 
normalized graph forms such as pie charts. Perhaps the distinguishing characteristicof social science 
data is that much of it is categorical or nominal. This has definite implications for graphical displays. 
 It is rare that social scientists have a continous function or curve to plot. Rather it is usually a 
series of disjoint points. Even line graphs are more properly thought of as a series of broken line segments. 
Thus social scientists tend to use graphic forms which retain the disjoint nature of their data, such 
as histo­grams, bar charts, and pie charts. Another characteristicof social science data is that data 
are often incomplete or missing. This happens in various ways. A time point is missing because a survey 
could not be conducted that year, or a question was not asked on purpose or by mistake. Any computer 
program designed to process social science data should contain appropriate procedures for recognizing 
and handling missing data when it is encountered. The combination of the reliance on packages and the 
need for specific graphic forms leads us to believe that social scientists will use computer graphics 
when they can do so by invoking packaged software which will mask the technical complexity of generating 
the graphic displays and be able to produce the desired graphic forms. Such graphic packages should be 
more than Fortran callable sub­ routines[ll] which require the user to know technical details. Rather 
they should be the Fortran code which calls the graphic subroutine and takes care of the details for 
the user. One of the details with which the user should not be bothered is having to know the limitations 
of the hardware. Most social scientists are unfamiliar 126 with anything beyond the most elementary 
aspects of hardware. Often their research is unfunded and hence they tend to rely on public property 
provided by university computing centers. Some social science departments purchase their own terminals, 
but usually these are character rather than graphic devices. Thus the graphic packages must allow for 
character input from user terminals and be able to produce graphics on off-line plotters as well as 
on graphic terminals. We have produced software which takes the above considerations into account and 
attempts to meet the needs of social scientists. The two modes of this software are named GRAPH and MULTIGROUP. 
 3. GRAPH GRAPH is an interactive computer program which is capable of producing plots on a user's 
terminal and plot description files for off-line plotting. We assume that users have some mental image 
of what the plots should look like as they sit at the terminal. GRAPH prompts them to enter information 
which controls the plotting. The amount of prompt­ing is kept to a minimum. The user enters the type 
of the desired graph, which can be a line graph, a bar chart, a histogram, a pie chart or three other 
specialized graph forms: floating bar, boxes and profile graphs. Once the graph type is entered the program 
prompts become specific to the chosen graph type, although strict compar­ability between prompts for 
different types is maintained when there is an isomorphism. Users are supplying labelling for the graphs 
and the basic plot information such as the number of graphs in a picture, the number of points in a 
graph and the minimum, maximum, and interval for the Y-axis. For much of the graph we assume a standard 
set of parameters which were designed after considerable review of the needs of social scientists. We 
found that most social science graphs can be thought of as having two dimensions, only one of which is 
continuous. The continuous dimension is used to display the value of a statistic. The other dimension 
represents groups which are related nominally though sometimes they are ordered; in rare instances (such 
as time series) they are intervals. We use this knowledge to build assump­ tions which minimize the 
prompting. For instance we do not ask for a coordinate value, rather we evenly space entries along the 
X-axis in the order mentioned by the user. Perhaps the easiest way to describe how GRAPH works is with 
an example. In Figure 1, we have reproduced a GRAPH session where the lines in lower case are typed by 
the user and the lines in upper case come from GRAPH. The user is requesting a line graph with 2 lines, 
each having four data points. Most of the information is labelling. Once the user has completed answering 
the prompts the picture will be drawn on the terminal. See Figure 2. At this point the graphic editor 
will be invoked. We assume that most users will want to modify the basic picture in some unpredictable 
way. Because the user's desires beyond the basic picture are 9 $run sm69;graph -sig76 #EXECUTION BEGINS

lower on the screen, we do not clutter the basic prompt sequence to deal with these preferences. Rather 
we assume a graphic editor will handle these situations. The editor presents the user with a menu of 
options. These are listed in Figure 3. The user selects an editor option by pointing to the menu. The 
editor will then prompt the user to point to the item to be altered. We expect the user to want to edit 
parts of the picture rather than partial areas of the screen. We have therefore created the picture 
as data structure made up of sub-pictures, any one of which can be edited by the user.[12] This data 
structure gives the editor its power. The user can point to any item on the screen and edit it. Thus 
pointing to any part of the title is sufficient identication to have the whole title blownup, replaced, 
colored or even deleted or moved. A typical picture might be made up of thirty or more sub-pictures. 
Figure 4 is an example of a section of a pie graph being moved by use of the graphic editor. The additional 
label­ ling was added at a point indicated by cursor placement. The emphasis in the graphic editor is 
to allow users to particularize any of our graphic forms to their specific needs. We would like to believe 
 that we are thus eliminating the need for a graphic artist to design displays for publication. We are 
sure some social scientists will need these artists anyway, but even these will find GRAPH useful for 
generating rough drafts of the desired displays. Those social scientists who draw their own displays 
will probably find GRAPH adequate for their needs. The range of displays which GRAPH can produce is 
indicated by examples of each of the basic graph types. See Figures 4 -10. With simple modifications 
using the editor this range can be extended. GRAPH was designed to handle the special problems of 
social scientists. It is usable by those who do not have graphics terminals it can handle missing data, 
and it is cheap enough to allow user  127  experimentationwith displays. In Figure 11 as an example 
of the character approximation of graphics produced by GRAPH on a character terminal. The user can preview 
plots on the terminal and then ask to have them run off on a plotter, probably off-line. Unfortunately 
graphic editing is not available when using character terminals. Missing data is most difficult to handle 
in line graphs: See Figure 12. The other graph types also handle missing data. Users often experiment 
with GRAPH by plotting the same values with a variety of graph types. We have facilitated this process 
by providing a default system. If a person would like to see a histogram and a line graph of the same 
data, that user goes through the prompt sequence for the histogram and then merely respecifies the 
graph type as line and defaults  Fig. 11 - Character Histogram Fig. 12 - Missing Data in a Line Graph 
everything else. GRAPH will have stored the previous replies and will use them whenever the person sends 
an asterisk. We have made one assumption in GRAPH that may not be entirely obvious. We have assumed 
that the user has already generated the values to be plotted using some analysis program. GRAPH cannot 
produce the statistics, it can only plot numbers. The user will probably have generated a stack of output 
and chosen those results which best exemplify some point they would like to communicate to others. We 
feel that a much more exciting role for graphics exists in linking graphics capabilities directly into 
the analysis programs. We have built this mode of usage into the Multigroup command within the Michigan 
Interactive Data Analysis System.  4. MULTIGROUP The MULTIGROUP command in MIDAS provides the user 
 with the ability to graphically display results in the process of doing data analysis. MULTI- GROUP 
users have data and would like statistics calculated on those data. We assume that the user would like 
a plot of that statistic over subsets of the data. Usually the user has labelled the variables and 
categories of the data and any plot MULTIGROUP generates will use these labels in the display. The 
statisticswhich the MULTIGROUP command is capable of producing are counts, marginal per­ centages, cummulative 
percentages, concordance coefficients, phi's tau's, lambda's, gamma's, rank tau's, correlations, and 
several others based on three-way cross-tabulations. Statistics are produced with confidence intervals 
when appropriate. We plot the statistic along the Y­ axis and the subsets along the X-axis, again using 
the X-axis as an ordinal axis. The graph types which MULTIGROUP can produce are lines, histograms, 
bars, pie, floating bars and variants of the line graph which handle cummulation. by MULTIGROUP. All 
the user had to tell MIDAS was: MULTIGROUP FUNCTION=MARG%VARIABLES=15 STRATA=V20 OPTION=FLOATBAR 
The parentheticalremark at the bottom of the plot was added by using the graphic editor which is also 
available with MULTIGROUP. The rest of the labelling is generated automaticallybecause the dataset 
contained that information.Because labelling is automatic,MULTIGROUP can be used to generate plots 
very quickly with less input from the user than GRAPH requires. We should also note that the floating 
bar graph in Figure 13 is an example of a graph type which is particularly useful for dichotomous data 
which is very common in the social sciences. MULTIGROUP should prove to be an important addition to 
MIDAS. It will make MIDAS an even more powerful teaching aid than it is already.[13] Under­ graduates 
use MIDAS even in freshmen social science courses. They need know only three commands: to read a dataset, 
to get a cross tabulation,  and to exit the program. These commands prompt the user for the necessary 
information. The problem which faces social science instructors is getting across the concepts inherent 
in a cross tabulation. The students must be taught how to read a table. Our experience is that the 
concept of a relationship within a cross tabulation is most easily presented graphically. The concept 
 of dependence seems to come across much quicker this way. With the MULTIGROUP command the student 
can get both the hands on experience inherent in interactive data analysis and the "aha" phe­ nomenon 
inherent in graphics. The skillful choice of data analysis assignments can drive the point home very 
quickly. For example, the cross tabulation of Congress­ man's party with their rating by The Americans 
 for Democratic Action yields a 2x4 matrix of counts. In the row corresponding to Democrats the counts 
increase with increasingADA score; the row for Republicans decreases. Yet the inference that ADA score 
is dependent upon party is less obvious to students when confrontedwith the matrix than when they see 
the information presented graphically as in Figure 14. To drive the point home even quicker one might 
also have them look at the means for the two groups as in Figure 15. The benefits inherent in interaction 
combined  with graphics leads us to believe that MULTIGROUP may pioneer a new mode of output display 
for canned analysis programs in general. We can imagine users demanding more and more of their output 
in graphical form rather than tabular form.  THE FUTURE The software which we have described is only 
part of what we think social scientists will want in the way of computer graphics. We feel we have only 
touched the basic needs. However, we have done this in such a way as to provide building  blocks for 
the future development. This develop­ ment will proceed in several different directions. One of the most 
interesting will be in the investi­gation of new ways of presenting information. An attempt to convey 
more information in a novel way is embodied in a graph form called "Boxes". See Figure 10. This graph 
form was created by Neal Oden. It is based on the notion that each cell in a cross tabulation has an 
expected frequency as well as an observed frequency. Each cell is represented by two concentric squares. 
The length of a side of the solid square is proportional to the cell's contributionto the observed frequency. 
The length of a side of the broken square is proportional to the expected frequency. Within each cell 
there are two lines forming an angle which is proportional to that cell's contribution to the total 
chi-square. This graph form packs a lot of information and neatly conveys the meaning of the relationship

 SPECIFYING SYMBOL INSTANCES (1,2) James D. Foley Department of Computer Science Universityof North

and dimensioning inthe master to specify instances of symbol definitions in general-purpose graphics 
programming languages.3 The processing required to each case isdescribed and compared. Dimensioning in 
the master iseasier to implement, can allow faster display of images because of simpler processing, 
and semantically is a bit less powerful than dimensioning in the instance. When appropriate, both can 
gracefully coexist in a graphics language, but the great majority of graphics applications only need 
the semantic power of dimensioning inthe master. Permission to make digital or hard copies of part

 The BGRAF2 language for interactive real-time 2D graphics was designed as a user-oriented language emphasizing 
ease of use rather than of implementation. Procedural statements allow straightforwardcomputationwhile 
classlike characteristicsencourage modular graphics program­ming. The clock and event data types facilitate 
creation of parallel and synchronousprocedures automaticallyacting on structures and display files. A 
graphic procedure, which includes procedural, drawing and event-driven statements, is a graphic prototype. 
Such procedures may be nested and iteratively or recursivelycalled. An individual invocation of a procedure, 
called a graphic object, shares code while commanding its own data structures and images. 1. INTRODUCTION 
 The BGRAF2 language is a higher level language es­pecially designed for interactive real-time two­dimensional 
graphics. The structured ALGOL-like procedural statements allow straightforward compu­tation, the class-like 
graphic procedures encour­age modular programming,and the implicit struc­tures lend autonomous dynamics 
to images. A graphic object is a time-, input-and computa­ tion-dependent instance of a graphic procedure. 
It is composed of explicitly drawn primitives (lines, points, characters), of sketches con­ structed 
from primitives, and of subobjectscreat­ ed by hierarchical "calls" to other graphic pro­cedures. A graphic 
object draws in its own co­ordinate system, defined in terms of the coordi­nate system of its parent. 
A call to a graphic procedure merely invokes a dynamic instance of that procedure, and thus, many such 
instances (objects) may be in effect simultaneously. Graphic recursion is permitted. The approach taken 
here to effect real-time chang­es on screen differs in principle from the stand­ard methods. According 
to traditional approaches the programmer either explicitly invokes system functions acting directlyon 
the display file (e.g., in GRIP [9]), or makes changes in a pseudo­ display file and recompiles the 
element which has been changed each time such a change is made (as in IMAGE [11]). The BGRAF2 language 
is based on neither of these approaches, but rather on what might be called "side effects". Graphic 
objects and primitives may be defined in terms of program variables, and the visual elements created 
may change automatically in real-time as these vari­ ables change their values. A graphic element, 
once defined, need not be referenced directly in order to change it. The side-effect approach is also 
employed in the real-time animation language ANIMA, mentioned by Csuri [5]. Explicit and implicit event-driven 
statements con­ trol the real-time processes in the language, while the procedural and graphic statements 
are used to initialize objects and data structures. Clocks and timers declared in the program synchronize 
the be­ havior of objects with the real-time (master) clock. Variables defined as functions of clocks 
act as "pseudo-clocks",changing in real-time according to any user-defined function. Graphic object 
defined in terms of these clocks or pseudo-clocks behave similarly. The BGRAF2 language, its use and 
implementation are presented informally in this paper. A complete definition of the syntax and semantics 
is given in [10].  2. DRAWING The graphic primitives of BGRAF2 are point, vector, and string. These 
are data types in the language, together with integer, real, boolean, etc. A point constant is given 
by (a,b), where a and b are num­ bers. It denotes an absolute position of a point in the coordinate 
system of an object. A vector constant <a,b> signifies a relative translation of the drawing beam. 
The beam is moved in two dimen­ sions by a sequence of such statements, each of the form:   commands. 
This sequence of statementsagain draws fig. la:  Both sequences,when executed, create identical display 
files and images. However, the second se­ quence creates an additional structure and mecha­nism to alter 
the display file as variables I, J and K receive new values. For example, the sub­sequent execution 
of I:=I+1; repositions the rec­tangle at (2,3), J:=8; widens it keeping the dot at its center, and K:=J/2; 
 changes the rectangle into a parallelogram,its nonvertical sides having slope of -1/2 as in fig. 1b. 
  The thermometer drawing is dynamically linked to variable N, changing whenever it does. The prefix 
operator # gives the current value of a variable at the time the drawing code is executed. Thus, the 
addition of this code:  adds a reference line to the thermometer represent­ ing the initial value of 
N. The initial image would be of the form given in fig. 2b, while later it might assume the form of fig. 
2c. The basic utility in parameterizinga drawing is its conceptual simplicity, allowing the programmer 
to draw once and to control the image by "pulling the strings from beyond the view of the audience". 
 This is emphasized by the following code which rubber-bandsa line segment from a fixed initium to an 
externally-controlled moving tracker. The system procedure track places the tracker at point P and alters 
P in accordance with the tracker mo­ tion. name and re-evaluatedwhenever its value changes. The definition 
statement is of the form: < variable> =< expression> ; and is non-procedural. A defined variable, being 
 an abbreviationfor an expression, may be defined only once within a procedure and cannot receive values 
by assignment or input. In the previous ex­ ample, we might have written the definition M=0.9*N; transforming 
the range of N to the range of its graphic representation,or, if we are not interest­ed in viewing N 
out of range: M = max(O,min(90,0.9"N));  Then the first mercury line is drawn by <M,O>; and M is evaluated 
anew whenever N changes.  Fig. 2 -ThermometerDrawing The third graphic primitive is string. Its con­ 
stants are defined by a character string delimited by single quotes. A string drawing statement con­ 
sists of a string constant or variable. The string is drawn from the current beam position, horizon­ 
tally in the current coordinate system, in standard character size. Thus, this code: ?(10,-30); 'VALUEOF 
N'; added to the thermometer code, labels the thermo­ meter as in fig. 2d. Graphic primitives may have 
properties such as intensity, type of line (solid, dotted, etc.), light-pen sensitivity, italics, blink, 
visibility, angle and size. Thes have either Boolean values or numeric values within certain ranges. 
Each property has a default value. Values may be as­ signed explicitly to graphic elements by appending 
a property and an expression giving the property value desired. For example: 'HELLO',intens:5,ital:true; 
 draws italic string "HELLO" with intensity level 5, while: ((X,Y),blink:BVC,intens:J+l; intensifies 
 a point at (X,Y)with intensity J+1. The point alters its intensity whenever J's value changes and blinks 
whenever Boolean BVC is true. Another graphic data type is the compound graphic element sketch, consisting 
of a parenthesized se­quence of graphic primitives and their properties. If S is of type sketch, then 
we may assign a fixed rectangle (6x3) whose base is light-pen sensitive (lps) and whose overall intensity 
is 5 by: ?#P; track(P); P; To simplify matters,a "defined" variable has been Sketch S may be displayed 
by a statement which  introduced. It is actually a function, called by names it, i.e., S; . A sequence 
of five rectangles is drawn by the loop:  The execution of a new assignment statement, e.g.:  assigns 
a new sketch to S. If S had already been drawn a number of times, each rectangle now reap­ pears as 
a triangle. However, if S had been origi­ nally drawn with the statement #s; indicating the current 
value of S, assignment will not alter pre­ viously drawn display elements.  3. CLOCKS Timing mechanisms 
and time-dependent events and objects in real-time systems and languages are in­ dispensable, as stated 
by Frailey [7] and Cardman [3]. The clock and event data types in BGRAF2 facilitate the creation of 
parallel and synchronous actions and procedureswhich automaticallyact on the data structures, display 
files and the scena­ rio. Since a clock variable may be used as an or­ dinary numeric variable, real-time 
motion is trivi­ ally definable. The automatic incrementation of the clocks result in real-time dependent 
objects which dynamicallychange their shape, position, size, orientation, and other properties. A 
clock is an ordered 4-tuple [V,F,S,P] where: V is the clock value, an integer counter automat­ ically 
incrementing (decrementing)by one every F basic time units; this variable is also used as the reference 
name of the clock;  F is the clock frequency in basic time units, an integer time interval that must 
lapse before  the clock value is modified; S is the clock state, a Boolean variable indicating whether 
the clock is "running" or "suspended";  P is the clock period, an integer which is the maximal number 
of value changes before V returns to its starting value.  A clock is locally declared in a type declaration 
 statement such as clock V(F,S,P); . In defining time mechanisms, BGRAF2 assumes a hardware device signaling 
at a constant frequency according to an external "wall clock". A 50 Hertz wall clock is assumed in all 
examples given below. The master clock, time, which ticks according to the hardware device, is a real-time 
uninterruptableclock. It starts running when execution of the program com­ mences, with value zero. 
All the user-defined clocks are synchronizedwith and geared from the master clock as in [3]. A user-defined 
clock is a timer in the sense that it is bound to the graphic procedure in which it is declared. A procedure 
call creates an instance of a procedure including instances of all clocks de­clared in it. When the instance 
terminates, clocks are deallocatedwith the rest of its data structure. The default initial values of 
the clock parameters are [O,l,true,oo],following the master clock. Other values must be explicitly 
stated, e.g., a "second" clock which starts at 0 and ticks each second with a period of one minute is 
declared: 6 clock V=0(50,S=true,0); The clock value can be altered during execution by assigning it 
a new value, an action known as re­ setting the clock, e.g., V:=30;. Other clock para­ meters whose associated 
variables have been declar­ ed may be changed by assignment. In the previous example, the execution of 
S:=false; stops clock V while S:=true; causes it to resume running. A clock and its associated variables 
may appear in any expression as ordinary numeric and Boolean var­ iables, enabling the definition of 
clock-dependent variables, or "pseudo-clocks". These are variables of any type (e.g., real, point) and 
are functions of a declared clock running at arbitrary rates. Clock mappings allow definition of automatic 
change or motion, as for example this illuminated point moving diagonally across the screen: clock K; 
...!(K,K); or this point tracing an exponentiallydecaying sinusoid from left to right:  The following 
code draws a horizontal sequence of vertical strokes across the screen (assuminga 0-1000 screen). The 
strokes seem to appear at screen-left, move across the entire screen at uni­form velocity,and disappear 
at screen-right. Ac­tually, only 50 strokes assume periodic motion.  Clocks, of course, have many other 
uses. In parti­cular, they are used in definingand controlling events. 4. EVENTS An event is an impulse 
function of time, defining a sequence of time-instants at which the event is said to "occur". It does 
not otherwise have a value per se in any finite time interval. In some ways it is like the timing signals 
called "events" in Brinch Hansen [2] used to synchronize concurrent processes that access common variables. 
In BGRAF2 an event expression or variable defines an event. An event variable can be declared (e.g., 
event E;) and explicitly triggered (e.g., signal E;). Boolean expressions (e.g., I>5) are event expressions. 
When so used, the event in question "occurs"at the instant that the expres­ sion value changes from false 
to true. An input expressionis an (external)event which occurs when certain actions take place on a 
peri­pheral unit and certain conditions are fulfilled, facilitating interaction between user and program. 
Input expressions are also event expressions,and thus, for example, the depression of the "Y" key on 
the keyboard, representedas key:'Y', or a light­pen hit on object OBJ, representedas lp:OBJ, are event 
expressions. A numeric, clock, or other variable also serves as an event expression, the event it represents 
occurring each time a value is (explicitly or implicitly)assigned to that vari­able. Various Boolean 
combinations of event ex­pressions and variables are also event expressions.  where the do-block is 
a single statement or a se­quence terminated by end. The do-block is immedi­ately scheduled for execution 
upon occurrence of the event. Ideally, it is executed asynchro­nously and in parallel with other ongoing 
processes. Clocks gear events to real time. If K is a clock, then it serves as an event expression 
(onKdo ...) which occurs each time K ticks (changes). Clock­driven events can be partially masked by 
Boolean expressions (on KAB do ...). A periodic clock in­troduces another event, occurring at the end 
of each period, given by the event-valued system func­tion period(K). Another event-driven statement 
is the pick state­ment, syntacticallysimilar to the procedural case. It selects one of a sequence of 
code-blocks for im­mediate execution when the user makes one of a number of designatedchoices on an 
input device. The device may be physical (e.g., keyboard, light­pen) or logical (e.g., menu). For example: 
 5. THE GRAPHIC PROCEDURE An underlying principle of BGRAF2 is the modulari­zation of dynamic objects. 
An object is an invoked instance of a graphic procedure, in some ways simi­lar to the objects of SIMULA 
classes [6]. A graph­ ic procedure represents any dynamic scenario, from a simple static sketch extending 
to an entire time­ and input-dependentdynamically changing sequence. Objects may be built up in time 
and space from sim­pler objects. Each object is a self-containedunit controlling its own "actions" within 
its own co­ ordinate system, and controlled from "above" by its "parent". A parent node in this structural 
tree need not be concernedwiththe structure of its distant descendents, since each of its subtrees is 
totally controlled by its immediate descendent, the subtree root. Thus, for example, a graphic proce­ 
dure TRAFFICmay create a number of subtrees called CAR, each of which calls procedure WHEEL a number 
of times. WHEEL can be defined as a wheel whose angular velocity is determined from its size and speed, 
given as parameters. CAR may define a ve­ hicle of varying size and shape, determined by its parameters. 
It invokes WHEEL a number of times, and as it moves, the WHEELs also move with it, be­ing linked to the 
CAR coordinate system. TRAFFIC invokes a number of CAR instances of different size and shape, dynamically 
altering their velocities. It is not even "aware" of the existence of WHEEL. Syntactically,a graphic 
procedure consists of a body of statements such as declarations,defini­tions, procedural statements 
(including statements which create graphic elements) and event-driven statements. A procedure itself 
is merely a proto­type, each invocation of which produces an instance called a graphic object. Such 
an object has a sep­arate existence, and is in one of two states, ac­ tive or passive. It is active immediately 
after invocation,remaining so until all its procedural  statements have been executed. In this state, 
events are inhibited and local clocks don't tick, permitting the completion of computations and the 
drawing of images before things start changing dynamically. When the object becomes passive, its event-driven 
statements are executed from time to time as events occur, and graphic images and data structureswhich 
are geared to clocks and pseudo­clocks change. The terminate statement terminates 136 a graphic object, 
deallocating its data structures and ending its existence. All its descendents are implicitly terminatedat 
that time. The geometric origin of an object is the current beam position when it is invoked. The mapping 
of its coordinate system to that of the screen is de­ clared in an optional screen statement preceding 
 the declarations. Other properties of the object, including size and angle which affect the coordi­nate 
system, may be appended in the call, much the same as they are appended to graphic primitives and sketches: 
 GEORGE(1,2,A+B),blink:BL,angle:ANG; If the properties are expressions (non-constant), they dynamically 
modify images produced by the in­ voked object, as well as those of its descendents. A graphic procedure 
need not draw anything itself. It may invoke other procedures to draw, while it manipulates their environments. 
Consider, for in­ stance, procedure DESCEND, which invokes an in­stance of procedure CHUTE and moves 
it down at con­stant velocity from its initial position on screen while rocking it back and forth in 
a pendulous mo­tion. These motions are accomplished by defining the angle and position of CHUTE relative 
to DESCEND's own coordinate system in terms of a clock of 200 ms. frequency. CHUTE's origin and angle 
are pseudo-clocks:  Procedure CHUTE can be any procedure whatsoever. The following example of CHUTE 
draws a parachute, calling external routine ARC (not defined here) to draw an arc defined by three points. 
Eleven cords are attached to object PAYLOAD not defined here. The payload bounces up and down with respect 
to CHUTE, cords rubber-bandingaccordingly, as defined by pseudo-clockY:  Top-down program design 
is facilitated by the graphic procedure structure. A procedure encom­passes not only the definition 
of graphic images, but also their time-, input-, and computation­ dependent behavior. This is again 
illustrated in the following program. The light-pen is used to draw a dotted curve, wherein the dots 
are about equally spaced. Each dot initially appears at maxi­mum intensity and eventually fades completelyand 
disappears, as if one were drawing with disappear­ ing ink. A procedure controlling the drawing need 
merely invoke procedure DOT at various times to draw a dot. DOT is independently defined as an in­tensified 
point whose intensity decreases with time  and which eventually terminates itself without be­ing told 
to do so. Procedure DOT, essentiallyin­ dependent of DRAW, employs a backward ticking clock which ticks 
from 7 to zero, one tick each three seconds. Its intensity is defined in terms of this clock. An instance 
of DOT terminates itself upon completion of the clock's period.  6. COMMUNICATIONBETWEEN OBJECTS Graphic 
objects may receive and convey information or commands from other graphic objects in a variety of ways. 
One mechanism is the variable of type event whose scope of validity is the entire pro­gram. Events are 
used to transfer signals within an object and throughout the program. A variable of any other type may 
be declared global and thus be known beyond the boundaries of the procedure in which it is declared. 
 Another standard method of communication is by def­inition of procedures with arguments (formal para­meters). 
In BGRAF2, all arguments are passed by reference. However, explicit reference to a parti­cular object 
may only be effected by use of refer­ence variables. Each reference variable points to an instance of 
a procedure currently in existence, either active or passive, or assumes the value null. If reference 
R points to an instance of A and the instance terminates, then R automatically assumes the null value. 
The operator  assigns reference at procedure invocation; reference R1,R2; ...A R1; ...A@R2; An object 
can be referred to in order to check, change or terminate it. Reference variables are especially needed 
because the same graphic proce­dure may be invoked a number of times, and the pro­cedure name does not 
uniquely identify any parti­cular instance of it. A reference variable may also point to a graphic primitive 
or sketch. If V is a vector, the state­ment V; simply draws a line segment. That speci­ fic line can 
no longer be referred to individually and its (default) properties cannot be changed. If a reference 
variable R is assigned to it (at the time it is drawn), V@R; , it may be referred to by that name. 
Its propertiesare explicitly available by dotted concatenation:  7. RECURSION Recursion is not a concept 
one usually associates with graphic procedures. However, repetition can frequentlybe replaced by recursion, 
simplifying the program in the process. A procedure may sketch something and then (conditionally)invoke 
another instance of itself to draw another sketch of the same type, and so forth. The following example 
is inspired by Hoare's tree in [6]. It illustrates that the use of recursion implicitlycreates a linked 
data structure of arbi­ trary complexity. The program draws a binary tree on screen correspondingto a 
binary expression. Then, according to light-pen hits, existing sub­ trees can be replaced by new ones. 
Graphic proce­dure TREE reads from the keyboard, symbol by sym­bol, the binary expression in prefix form, 
and con­structs the correspondingbinary tree. The two symbols "+" and "*" are considered binary operators 
while all others are considered operands (leaves of the tree). Subtreesare positioned closer and closer 
together as one descends the tree. Graphic procedure NODE draws a node and recursivelycalls itself to 
draw subtrees if it is not a leaf. The event-driven statements exchange the corresponding subtree of 
NODE with a new one, again read from the keyboard.  8. IMPLEMENTATION BGRAF2 is a non-standard language, 
and its imple­mentation must deal with its unusual features such as timing mechanisms, parallelism, events, 
image manipulation, and user interaction, as well as or­dinary procedural structures. A BGRAF2 source 
pro­gram is compiled to an object module consisting of a sequence of pure code blocks and a set of data 
blocks. The run-time environment is comprised of the object module and five additional processors, the 
Scheduler, the Real-Time Processor, the Graph­ics Processor, the CommunicationsProcessor, and the Memory 
Manager. The Scheduler is responsible for scheduling code blocks for execution according to a hierarchical 
priority scheme. The procedural blocks correspond to the active states of objects, and are given low­est 
priority. Event-controlled,drawing, and definition code blocks are scheduled on queues representing "pseudo-now"--code 
blocks which must be executed "immediately". A still higher priority level is commanded by the Real-Time 
Processor which handles clocks and timing, and by the Communica­tions Processor, which is responsible 
for I/O and interaction. Slippage [8] is detected and handled by the Scheduler. In camera or debug mode, 
the line clock is disconnected from the system and the Scheduler empties its queues, signaling the comple­ 
tion of the current frame, and waits for an exter­nal signal before proceeding. This signal acts in place 
of a line clock tick. The Graphics Processor maintains the display files and an auxiliary tree, modeling 
the existing objects and their coordinate spaces and transformations. Each time a procedure is invoked, 
a new data area is allocated for the newly created object, but the same reentrant code is used. A variable 
in the data area is represented by two fields, the first of which contains its value. The second refers 
to a variable-lengthlinked list of pointers, each of which identifies a block of code to be executed 
 "immediately" every time a value is assigned to the variable. BGRAF2 is operating in an experimental 
restricted form on a PDP 11/40 computer with a GT-42 graphics unit. A more complete implementation is 
currently being developed. A non-real-timeversion employing storage tube and plotter graphics is being 
imple­mented on a CDC Cyber 72. 9. CONCLUDING NOTES BGRAF2 is but an experimental language, an attempt 
to make real-time interactive graphics programming more natural, more modular. The language, associ­ 
ated processors, and the ideas behind them are a first attempt. The language is not as complete as we 
would have liked to see. The assumptions we made in designing the BGRAF2 language are: (1) The programmer 
does not need elaborate data structures representing his images outside those which he uses to draw with 
directly; (2) The language has sufficient versatility (or, more prosaically, system functions) to let 
the programmer monitor and control his images; (3) Drawings are two-dimensional in nature, not projections 
from three-dimensional data structures.  The most basic assumption is the first, since the language 
possesses a dual-purpose data structure for images --as computations take place, images change autonomously. 
This is both a restriction of programmer freedom, and in the view of the authors, a powerful tool.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Richard G. Kellner Lynn D. Maas Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Los Alamos, 
New Mexico 87545 ABSTRACT A low cost intelligent graphics terminal for developmental work consisting 
of a Tektronix storage tube terminal and an ALTAIR 8800 microcomputer is described. The microcomputer 
system is used to develop and debug customized intelligent terminal configurationsand features before 
a production model is finalized and fabricated. This allows flexibility in terminal design and allows 
changes to be tried easily before final versions are built. The customized terminal features that are 
 described are the abilities to process a segmented display file, to provide refresh of up to 130 characters 
or vectors, to control accessory devices such as a flexible disk and a graphics tablet, to provide data 
compression of over 60% on large pictures, and to provide a local debugging utility. 1. Introduction

Alamos Scientific Laboratory length of the draw and the resolution being there are two time-sharing 
systems available to used, and a move takes from three to six users at remote sites through a system 
of characters. We are neglecting the infrequent dedicated data communication lines. The KRONOS special 
cases of short horizontal draws or system is available on three CDC 6600-class moves, which take one 
or two characters, respectively. machines and LTSS, the Livermore Time-Sharing System, is available 
on two CDC 7600 machines. The data lines from the various locations in the At 300 baud, a maximum of 
15 vectors or  moves could be sent each second. However the Laboratory are connected to the computers

One of the KRONOS machines is also because of the limited size of the system output buffers time-share

systems are is a usable data rate with our time-sharing systems. For larger pictures, the drawing time

capability that involve large pictures. by themselves, several features that significantly improve 
their performance in our 2.1 Data Compression environment can be provided by the addition of a small 
amount of local processing power. Several Typically,our pictures are composed of  of these features

low data rates between sequence do not change very much. This property the host computers and the terminals. 
We have can be used as the basis for a data compression interfaced a MITS ALTAIR 8800 microcomputerto 
a scheme. Tektronix 4015 graphics terminal in order to develop some of these features. The stand-alone 
Tektronix graphics  terminals are addressable in terms of absolute The custom features that we have

1024 x 1024 resolution, this implies that it are data compression, menu refresh, control of takes 20

three constructed that would have one or more of these bits of each character being redundant features

high order five 2. Custom Terminal Features bits of X data have not changed from those of the last

by the terminal. In speeds involved, complex pictures take a this sense, two of the three bits mentioned 
 relativelylarge amount of time to paint on the above are not redundant because they are used to indicate 
whether a character represents X or Y data, and low or high order bits. Thus, a stand-alone Tektronix 
graphics terminal has a certain amount of data compression built into it. However, for pictures that 
have the property mentioned above, it is desirable to be able to use relative coordinates for addressing 
 points. If endpoints of successive vectors in a sequence have not changed much, it does not take many 
bits of information to represent the change; however, some information must also be present that tells 
how many bits of data correspond to a given point. There is more than one way to implement the above 
ideas. The amount of data compression attainable with a given scheme is picture dependent so that an 
adaptive scheme would seem desirable. However, a fixed scheme can be implemented that works well for 
a variety of pictures, yet still gives very good data compression for pictures composed mainly of very 
 short vectors. The method operates on sequences of vectors such that in a given sequence, the endpoints 
of successive vectors do not change by more than a fixed amount n (which can vary from sequence to 
 sequence) in absolute screen coordinates. The data is packed as n-bit relative coordinate information 
into 8-bit characters for transmission to a terminal. These sequences, with their corresponding n, 
are recognized by the terminal by means of certain control characters. For a given picture, n should 
be chosen as small as possible in a given sequence, otherwise a loss of data compression would result. 
Also, the number of sequences in a picture should be minimized because of the overhead of the control 
 characters that must be sent to signify a sequence. These two conditions are not always compatible, 
so that a compromise must be reached. A fine mesh is an example of the type of picture for which the 
method works well. Meshes typically arise when partial differential equations are numerically solved 
by a finite element or a finite difference scheme. Usually we can take n = 5 or 6 for these pictures 
and obtain up to 60% data compression compared to the usual Tektronix data format. A disadvantage 
of the above data compression scheme is that if there is a transmission error in one of the compressed 
 sequences, the picture can become greatly distorted. If one of the packed data characters is received 
incorrectly the portion of the picture represented by the rest of that sequence will be translated from 
the correct version. This does not happen with absolute coordinate data. If a control character is missed, 
the result is much worse. Thus, an error detection scheme might be a worthwhile addition to the data 
compression scheme, depending upon the quality of the data lines between the host computer and the 
microcomputer. 2.2 Selective Refresh A capability that is very desirable in certain applications is 
the ability to refresh selected information on the screen of the terminal. For example, there might 
be a large amount of stored picture information on the screen while only a menu is being refreshed. 
If the menu were stored and the screen erased every time the menu area filled up a large amount of 
 time would be spent needlessly in repainting the picture information.  In addition to storage capability, 
the 4015 has a limited refresh capability. For hardware characters, the refresh limit is 4000 characters 
per second, which is about 130 characters at a 30 Hertz refresh rate. Vector refresh is limited by 
the line rate between the microcomputer and the terminal, but cannot exceed 5000 inches per second. 
Tektronix sells a custom product "display buffer" that can be used for refresh purposes independentlyof 
a microcomputer [4]. This buffer can drive the terminal at the full refresh rate. However, the display 
buffer is almost as expensive as the complete microcomputer system. On the other hand, the display 
buffer plugs into the terminal s minibus, making a more compact arrangement. Therefore, depending upon 
the application involved, it might be desirable to use the display buffer alone, the microcomputer alone, 
 or both the display buffer and the microcomputer. If the microcomputeris used alone for refresh, a 
high speed interface (TTY-port interface) must be used instead of a RS232 interface to take full advantage 
of the terminal s speed. The display buffer might be used alone for those applicationswhere the added 
capabilitiesof the microcomputer are not needed. The microcomputer might be used alone for those applications 
requiring several custom features. Both the display buffer and the microcomputermight be used when it 
is inconvenient to have a TTY interface on the Tektronix terminal or when the microcomputer would be 
overtaxed without the display buffer. 2.3 Device Control The microcomputer is well-suited to use as 
a controller for a graphics tablet or a flexible disc. Our time-sharing systems will accept input data 
strings only if they are less than a certain length and conform to a certain format. However, it is desirable 
to be able to send large amounts of data from a tablet or disk to the host computers. Consider the 
case where one wants to draw curves on the tablet and have the coordinates sent to a host machine. This 
is useful, for example in interactively solving boundary value problems for partial differential equations. 
 A Tektronix tablet has a mode in which it continuously samples the pen position and generates coded 
coordinates. However, our time-sharing systems will not accept these continuous strings of data. But, 
by having the microcomputer store the data, block it into suitably sized and formatted blocks, and ship 
the data to the host one block at a time upon prompts by the host the continuous mode of the tablet 
becomes usable. Communication between the tablet and the microcomputer is accomplished by means of certain 
fixed control characters that the tablet is equipped to generate for these purposes. The Tektronix 
flexible disks are equipped to send data to a host in a prompted block mode if the data on the disk has 
previously been assembled into blocks of the appropriate size, separated by carriage return characters. 
 Clearly, there are cases when the data will not have this format, and the microcomputer can then be 
used to send the data as outlined above. The microcomputer also makes feasible the use of a flexible 
disk or a graphics tablet of another manufacturer to obtain special features or lower cost in a specific 
application. The only requirement is that the microcomputer be equipped with an I/O port with the appropriate 
 kind of interface to the disk or tablet. Much of the same software in the host computer that is used 
for the Tektronix disk or tablet can be used for another manufacturer'sdisk or tablet. The microcomputer 
handles the conversion between the various control sequences,block sizes, and, in the case of the tablet, 
coordinate codes. 2.4 Segmented Display File The ability to support a segmented display file [2] that 
is stored locally at the terminal can be useful in those applicationswhere only part of a picture changes 
between viewings. Only those segments of a picture that change between viewings are retransmitted from 
the  host. In storage mode, the 4015 is capable of generating 1000 hardware characters per second. 
The vector writing rate is the same as in refresh mode. Therefore, great savings are possible in data 
communicationstime and in picture repaint time. The segmented display file can be stored on a flexible 
disk or in the microcomputer's memory. The Tektronix flexible disk interfaces directly to the terminal's 
minibus and can transmit data to the terminal at a rate of 6000 baud. If the memory of the microcomputer 
is used for storing the display file, then direct memory access (DMA) to the terminal would be a desirable 
feature. Segmentation is handled with a minimal amount of software in the host computer, in addition 
to the Tektronix software. These additions are in the form of a library of FORTRAN subroutines. These 
subroutines include open, close, append, delete, paint, display, and undisplay. "Open" and "close" are 
used in conjunction with each other to define a segment and to cause it to be stored. Segments are 
only stored in the memory of the microcomputer. "Append" is used to add to the contents of a segment 
and "delete" is used to delete a segment. A display flag is associated with each segment. When the 
"paint" subroutine is called, all segments that have their display flag set are drawn on the terminal. 
The display flags can be set and reset by the "display" and "undisplay" subroutines respectively. The 
 memory of the microcomputer is managed by a linked list scheme. A related function is storing display 
 subroutines or templates [2] locally at the terminal. This has obvious application to logicor electronic 
circuit design. The display subroutines could be descriptions of the commonly used circuit symbols in 
relative coordinates. A circuit design or analysis program in the host computer could display a symbol 
by transmitting to the terminal a symbol identifier and positioning data, not a detailed description 
of that symbol in absolute coordinates. Any vectors that lie partially or totally outside the viewing 
area after positioning are forced to the boundary. Better clipping will be provided in later versions. 
 2.5 Program Debugging The microcomputer can serve as a very  useful debugging utility. For example, 
character sequences that produce very strange behavior may be sent to the terminal. When this happens 
because of some software or hardware error, it can be very difficult to locate. Such things have happened 
because of system errors on both time-sharing systems. The microcomputer can track down such problems 
by triggeringon specified character sequences and by storing the transmitted data bordering on the 
trigger  points. The stored data can then be sent one character at a time to the terminal, thus trapping 
the offending character(s) without manually searching through and decoding a paper tape full of hundreds 
of characters. The microcomputer can also be used as a  diagnostic tool to check out graphics terminals. 
 A program written to sequentiallyexercise all of the various modes of the terminal can aid greatly 
in locating hardware problems.  3. Hardware and Software of the Developmental System The technology 
for implementing the functions we have described with a microprocessorhas existed for several years. 
 However, it is only recently that hardware prices have dropped to the point where we could consider 
putting such a system on every Tektronix graphics terminal at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory 
that could potentially benefit from it. Our philosophyhas been to purchase, rather than design, hardware 
whenever possible. Furthermore, we program in a high level language, PL/M [1], to keep software costs 
 to a minimum, except when the executable code is too slow. Our developmental system consists of a 
MITS ALTAIR 8800 microcomputerand a Tektronix 4015 storage tube graphicsterminal. The ALTAIR microcomputer 
uses an INTEL 8080 8-bit microprocessor,which executes all instructions in 2-9 microseconds and can 
directly address up to 64K of memory. A bus structure is used on which the I/O lines, the memory address 
lines control signals, power supply voltages for TTL and MOS circuits, etc., are available. A large 
number of accessoryboards that plug into the bus are available from MITS and other manufacturers. We 
have 9K of 8-bit word volatile semiconductormemory, 4K of EROM nonvolatile memory, two I/O channels 
with RS232C interface, and two I/O channels that can interface to either RS232C, TTL levels, or TTY 
 20 milliampere current loop standards. The complete microcomputer costs under $1600. Both volatile 
and nonvolatile memory is available for less than 2/3 cent per bit on 4K memory boards. A real time 
clock vectored interrupt capability, and DMA would enhance our abilities to perform the functions that 
we have described, and these will be added to the system as they become commercially available. The 
I/O boards can accept any of the standard ASCII characters with or without a parity bit. However, the 
boards had to be modified to enable them to transmit and receive a "break" control signal, which is 
used by both of our time-sharing systems. Our Tektronix 4015 is equipped with a 4921 flexible disc, 
a 4953 graphics tablet and a Tektronix special product display buffer. The 4015 also has an enhanced 
graphicsmodule that provides features useful in some applications, such as 4096 x 4096 point addressabilityand 
 hardware dashed and dotted lines. Source code for the microcomputer is written in the PL/M language. 
PL/M is similar to, but simpler and more systems-oriented than PL/1, and can be learned in several 
days by anyone who is familiar with a high-level programming language. We have a PL/M cross-compiler 
implemented on both the KRONOS and LTSS time-sharing systems. There is also an 8080 simulator that can 
be used, among other things, for timing measurements on portions of code. A cross-assembleris available 
that we use for optimizing code that is too slow from the compiler and for writing heavily used subroutines. 
All of the above software packagesare INTEL products that are written in FORTRAN. Once the executable 
code has been generated on one of the time-sharing systems, we "down line load" it via the data communication 
lines into the microcomputer by means of a loader permanently stored in EROM. The code can then be tested 
and changes can be made either by keying them in directly at the microcomputer or by changing the source 
code on the time-sharing system. When a code is completely debugged, it can be put in EROM for use in 
a dedicated microcomputer system. Control character sequences are used to switch between the various 
modes of the microcomputer system. The down-line loader has simple checksum error checking and handshaking 
with the software in the host computer. It requires about 600 eight-bit words of storage for the program 
 itself. Programs for refresh segmentation, controlling peripherals,and debugging all require similar 
amounts of program storage. Programs for data compression and subroutining are longer, but the actual 
lengths can vary greatly depending upon the exact implementation. Conclusion An ALTAIR 8800 microcomputerconnected 
to a Tektronix graphics terminal provides a low cost intelligent graphics terminal that can handle the 
functions described in this paper. Software costs are minimal because the programming for the microcomputercan 
be done in a high-level language. Also, we have only implemented functions that involve a minimum of 
software changes in the host computer to the previously existing software. There are several functions 
that would be useful but would involve major software additions and changes in the host computer. For 
example, conic sections could be sent by the host computer in parametric form and decoded by the microcomputer. 
However, applications software would have to be written that would take advantage of this capability. 
This is a nontrivial task if general purpose codes are desired. A data compression scheme for text, such 
as described in [3], is another example. REFERENCES [1] INTEL -"A Guide to PL/M Programming" Rev.

95819 A low cost graphic and data collection facility consisting of a storage tube display, plotter, 
 digital multimeter, floppy disc, calculator and BCD instrumentationinterface has been built into a single, 
mobile unit. Laboratory data may be collected automaticallyby recording the output of the low speed 
digital multimeter or medium speed BCD DMA interface in calculator memory and then buffering the data 
to either floppy disc or tape cassette. The data can be summarizedand displayed immediately on the CRT 
or plotter by the calculatorusing programs available on a floppy disc resident library. Alternatively, 
the data can be routed to one of two timesharing computer systems at speeds up to 9600 baud where 2-D 
and 3-D software packages and large application libraries can be used to construct more sophisticated 
displays for presentation interactively on the CRT. Various applications appropriate to a university 
environment are dis­ cussed.  A similar facility at the Sacramento offices of the Army Corps of Engineers 
used for flood information reporting is also described. 1. INTRODUCTION One year ago the California 
State University at Sacramento (CSUS) found itself in a situation familiar to a number of medium sized 
campuses. The computing resources available to the campus community were available in isolated pockets 
of processing power distributed over the campus. CSUS is one of 19 campuses in the Calfornia State 
 University and Colleges (CSUC) system which main­ tains a large batch facility and a centralized 96 
port timesharing system for use by all campuses. The Sacramento campus has a local batch computer with 
a communications link to the large machine and eight ports into the timesharing facility. In addition, 
CSUS has its own 32 port timesharing minicomputer system and a number of small, stand alone, limited 
capacity minicomputers. Sheer pro­cessing power seemed adequate but the campus lacked facilities for 
real time acquisition and storage of data in a form compatible with any of the larger processors, and 
had no graphics capability whatever. Lacking a comprehensive network linking available processors with 
on-site data acquisition and dis­play terminals, the University sought an affordable solution to the 
problem of servicing the data col­lection and display needs in the physical science laboratories. These 
laboratories are located in close proximity to one another in a large science building which also houses 
the computer center. It was decided that an effective, though interim, solution might be to develop an 
integrated, portable unit with the needed capabilities that could be shared among a number of disciplines. 
 The component list had to include a CRT terminal with vector graphics, X-Y plotter, auxiliary storage, 
analog-to-digital converter and a pro­ grammable processor with sufficient interfacing and capability 
to control the flow of information between the components. The local mini timeshar­ing system has 16 
hardwired and 16 dialup ports and since the eight ports to the large central facility are also dialup, 
it was necessary that the graphics terminal be able to communicate with either system over the switched 
telephone network at 110 to 300 baud and up to 9600 baud via the hardwired, RS232 ports on the mini. 
The central timesharing computer would provide 32K user parti­tions, virtually unlimited on-line file 
storage capacity and a good FORTRAN compiler for the type of applications anticipated. The terminal con­figurability 
capabilities of the local mini time­ sharing operating system--specificallythe baud rate select/option--wouldprovide 
a means for moving laboratory data into files on a system on which an extensive applications software 
library already exists. The requirements were met with the system which is described below. The cost 
of the hardware was about $22,000. A similar facility was acquired by the Sacramento District Army Corps 
of Engineers. Many common problems and applications have been broached through a cooperative arrangement 
between Corps of Engineers personnel and Computer Science department faculty and students. A discussion 
of the system and current and potential applications follows. 2. DISPLAY STATION CONFIGURATION A 
number of vendors supply stand alone data ac­quisition and or display systems that meet some or all the 
above requirements. Tektronix, Inc. components were chosen primarily because of the low cost, high 
resolution characteristics of the model 4010-1 graphics terminal [1,2]. The calcu­ lator was a political 
and fiscal compromise that has proven to be adequate at least for the short run. The diagram in Figure 
1 illustrates the system as currently configured.  Fig. 1 - Display Station Diagram All components 
including the terminal have been mounted on a specially designed cart three feet wide by three feet high 
by six feet long. The cart may be easily moved into any lab or classroom on campus from its usual location 
in the graphics laboratory in the computer center. Also located (permanently)in the graphics lab is 
 an additional model 4010-1 and a hard copy unit connectable to either terminal. The floppy disc unit 
is an essential component in this configuration. Each disc has 64 tracks, 32 sectors per track and 
128 bytes per sector. Any track can be addressed and read/write opera­ tions initiated manually by means 
of front panel controls. The terminal-to-discinterface allows complete control of the disc unit by 
means of control character sequences keyed in from the keyboard when off line, or computer generated 
 sequences when on line. The calculator can address the disc, as well, through its own inter­ face as 
shown in Figure 1. The terminal and the disc can be disabled or enabled independently with appropriate 
control sequences. Consequently, users can view the disc drive as a separate on line peripheral, a 
calculator peripheral or as off line storage for displays on the 4010. The specifications and characteristics 
of the other components will be discussed as various modes of operation are described. 3. MODES OF 
OPERATION The overriding concern in the development of this facility was the ease of use by faculty 
and stu­ dents. It is not necessary for the user to reconfigure the system for any of the modes of 
operation described below. In only one case does he have to depress two otherwise unused switches located 
on the terminal and disc units. In all other modes the user need only be concerned with the operating 
characteristics of the devices he wishes to use in an application. He need not worry about the physical 
interconnections of the com­ponents on the cart--only the external devices in a data acquisition experiment. 
A discussion of five different modes of operation follows. 3.1 Low Speed Data Acquisition, Storage 
and Display Laboratory experiments involving AC or DC voltage, current, resistance or temperature measurements 
 can be input to the digital multimeter and the digital output routed to the calculator display register. 
Experiments with small amountsof data may be sampled periodically in this manner and recorded in register 
memory and stored on a disc or tape cassette file for further analysis. A CRT or X-Y plotter display 
can be generated simultaneouslywith acquisition or upon conclusion of the experiment. Depending on the 
range of measurements taken, the step response of the digital multimeter ranges from less than a second 
to up to 10 seconds. For typical applications, a realistic sampling rate is two samples per second under 
calculatorprogram control. The digital counter may be used in conjunction with the multimeter if samples 
need be collected at precise intervals in real time. The counter can measure frequency, period, ratio 
and time intervals. A clock rate switch on the front panel of the counter can change the frequency of 
the number of pulses generated by an internal time base from one second to one microsecond. In other 
words, the counter can serve as an internal clock which can be interogated by the calculator to assure 
proper sequencing of activities in the acquisition and display of data in a real time experiment. 3.2 
Stand Alone Plotting Facility A user with data to display as a point or continu­ous plot or histogram 
may do so on either the CRT or X-Y plotter using standard, calculator-based, plot software packages. 
Data is entered via the calculator keyboard or generated by user written subprograms and various keyword 
templates are used with the calculator's function keys to enable the user to easily invoke the desired 
subroutine. 3.3 Medium Speed Data Acquisition and Storage In this mode, the general purpose BCD interface 
may be connected to any one or all of six digits of any BCD device by means of a specially con­structed 
logic patch board available on the cart. With the use of this patch board, any type cable from the BCD 
device may be wired to the appropriate lines of the BCD interface (least significant digit to most significant 
digit, data ready sig­nals, etc.) Also, if the device is controllable,  up to four triggers, addressable 
by the calculator through the interface, can be strapped into the proper cables on the device through 
the patch board. Up to eight, one bit lines can be moni­ tored through an array of light emitting diodes 
 and an external clock pulse generator with select­ able rates can be patched into any input or output 
 line on the board. The BCD interface utilizes the external bus (i.e., DMA) facility of the calculator 
to write a number of samples into a predetermined area of calculator memory. While the BCD interface 
can effect transfers directly into memory at rates up to 15K bytes per second, the addressable register 
memory capacity even in the largest calculators (1K bytes) severely limits the volume of data which 
can be acquired and stored even when buffered to disc. Since the single DMA channel must be shared 
by both disc and BCD inter­ face, high speed data bursts can be successfully recorded and sequentiallystored 
on a disc file if they are separated in time by at least one second. A double buffering scheme has 
been used in cases when the Nyquist sampling rate is low enough to route each sample to the display 
registers by the data bus and then to one of two rotating register memory buffers which is then dumped 
to a floppy disc file when full. 3.4 Disc-computer Data Transmission Data recorded on satellite disc 
in a real time experiment by any of the techniques above can be forwarded to a host disc file on either 
time­ sharing system by using essentially a "paper tape mode" of operation available on the 4010 terminal­to-disc 
interface. When the terminal is connected to a computer port through its communications facility, the 
data generated and stored on disc by the calculator can be transmitted 8 bits at a time to the computer 
where a conversion algo­ rithm reformats a 64 bit BCD number to its ASCII real equivalent and stores 
it on a user file. The user can then operate on this data with any number of large software packages 
available in­ cluding the graphics software mentioned below. If summary data is to be transmitted back 
to the satellite disc for further use by the calculator (such as to be displayed on the X-Y plotter) 
the inverse algorithm is used. These algorithms, trivial as they are even in a language like FORTRAN, 
are inefficient and cumbersome to implement in the calculator language primitives. 3.5 Conversational 
Graphics CSUS has implemented a considerable amount of graphics software on the large timesharing system 
in support of the CRT in a conversational mode. Fairly complete, though rather typical, two and three 
dimensional FORTRAN-based packages exist for constructing displays on the 4010 and for supporting the 
graphics input mode available on the terminal. The distinguishing feature of this mode of opera­tion 
is the inclusion of the floppy disc in the interlocution between graphics terminal and computer. An 
entire (or the important parts therein) on-line graphics session on a slow dialup port can be recorded 
on disc and played back in local mode at 6500 bps or greater. This facili­tates classroom demonstrations,picture 
formatting, report generation, hard copy production and even affords a limited opportunity to investigate 
computer animation. Satellite disc files can be created and managed with a small number of FORTRAN 
subroutines which can be considered a part of the graphics library although they can of course be used 
separately. It is appropriate then to consider meaningful and useful (pseudo)display file structures 
[9] which can be organized and located on the terminal disc. The logical structure of the display file 
must be managed by the timeshare user library routines until such time as the user is satisfied with 
the display. Then the display file can be reorganized sequentially on disc for later playback in local 
 mode. 4. SUPPORT SOFTWARE  The Terminal Control System [3,10], Advanced Graphics II [3] and Character 
Generation System [5] software have been implemented on the central timesharing facility as major components 
in a  graphics user library. While these packages are large and consume more space and time than actu­ 
 ally necessary for most user requirements, they have been used because of adequate and readily available 
documentation. For this reason also, these packages have been used as the foundation for the development 
of a reasonably complete 3D package with rotation, projection and three standard hidden line removal 
algorithms: 420 [6], 475 [7] and 483 [8]. In addition, two rudi­ mentary,2D display file constructors 
exist for experimental use, together with a primitive file management facility for the floppy disc. 
A simple CALCOMP-like language is under development for the timesharing library which will generate 
 properly formatted data which can then be trans­ mitted to the satellite disc and then displayed by 
the calculator on the X-Y plotter. A large amount of calculator based software is available for the 
TEK 31 systems. This software is simply a collection of utilities and is not unlike most calculator software 
ranging from applications in most science disciplines to support programs for peripherals sold by the 
company. Unfortunately,it is all tape based but through a calculator file management package, a suitable 
floppy disc resident user library has been con­ structed which is easier and faster to use. 5. APPLICATIONS 
 In this section some of the applications developed on this system are presented. Each example illustrates 
one or more modes of operation described above and emphasizes how the display station has proven effective 
in a troublesome situation in which many potential users of infor­mation display systems find themselves. 
Lacking a local facility with an adequate graphics support environment and/or faced with remote timesharing 
facilities with limited line speeds and possibly not inconsequentialconnect-time costs, users may use 
the disc in a manner analogous to the display processor memory in an interactive intelligent graphics 
satellite. A display file can be con­structed on the disc which represents the static information in 
any particular display and used to regenerate that information locally on demand, thereby saving costly 
and slow retransmissionof that data. To illustrate this, consider Figures 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 the legend 
and labeled grid for a month by month breakdown of campus computer utilization is produced one time with 
a relatively simple program in the FORTRAN-based graphics package and stored on disc. An annual utilization 
profile for each campus computer facility can be plotted on the same grid with only the actual data and 
appropriate labeling generated and transmitted over the lines. Fig. 3 illustrates an interactive curve 
fitting program employed by an introductory class in Engineering graphics. Here the student attempts 
to set parameters in one of a set of parameterized functions to fit a curve to data collected in an experiment. 
For each set of data and function type specification, the grid and menu sheet is generated once and stored 
on disc. By pressing two front panel disc controls the student can regenerate instantaneouslythe menu 
and grid for another trial.  In a joint effort between the CSUS Computer Science Department and engineers 
at the Sacramento District Army Corps of Engineers, an analysis of the graph­ ics requirements in the 
periodic generation of reports on Californiawater projects revealed that seventy to eighty percent 
of the data required to generate the displays did not change from one report period to the next--primarilydue 
to the extensive display formats selected. The Corps is under contract for timesharing service and the 
 cost to generate the two displays in Fig. 4 on a Tektronix model 4014 terminal was about $17 and took 
five minutes on a 300 baud line. By storing the templates for each of the reports on floppy disc either 
template can be put up on the CRT in less than 5 seconds and the actual data transmitted and overlaid 
on the display in about one minute. Two tracks on a floppy disc will hold the data for one template at 
a cost of less than $.30, based on an estimated $9 per disc. With the large number of reservoirs and 
other public works proj­ects currently being monitored, the eventual cost savings could be significant. 
  Fig. 3 -Interactive Curve Fitting and Display Fig. 4 (b) -Reservoir Daily Report Tabulation A temperature 
monitoring and display experiment is shown in Figure 5. A calculator routine allows the user to preset 
the scaling factors, the CRT screen window and a simple grid is then dis­played. The program enters a 
wait state until the user initiates the counter by a front panel switch whereupon the output from a temperature 
probeconnected to the multimeter is simul­taneously recorded and plotted once every second over a 30 
second interval. By changing the screen window between runs, multiple displays  At a fixed wavelength, 
the absorbance of a reactant in a first order chemical reaction can be measured at precise time intervals 
by sampling the counter,recording and storing the output of the spectro­ photometer. In this case, the 
absorbance at 450 nanometers of bromine in the bromination of acetone was recorded and stored every one 
half second. Data was then scaled, plotted and labeled using the AGII and CGS software on the large 
timesharing system. It should be noted that in this experiment the rate at which data can be collected 
is limited by the chemical reaction and characteristicsof the spectrophotometer and does not demonstrate 
the full capabilities of the BCD interface.  6. CONCLUSIONS This system can be used to simultaneously 
acquire and display data, but it has been observed that most users prefer to wait for hard copy until 
suit­ ably labeled grids can be developed using the timesharedgraphics support software. The floppy 
disc drive will continue to play an important role in most applications simply because one floppy disc 
holds as much as forty tape cassettes but costs less than one cassette. Tapes are primarily used as 
the medium for trading cal­culator routines with other TEK 31 users.  In summary, the display station 
and the similar facility at the Corps of Engineers are coming into heavy use in many different types 
of applications. As use and interest increases so will the demand for more advanced display systems. 
Currently, the availability of adequate software tools for  program development on various microprocessor 
systems, coupled with their low cost, would suggest that the next logical step is to replace the calculator 
with a microsystem as the controller. There will be no attempt to rehost all the graphics support software 
on the microsystem--anunnecessary and costly duplication. But such a step would lead  naturally to 
the development of a simple command language to facilitate the selection, use and control of the peripherals. 
At this point in time, however, it is felt that acquisition and applica­tion of the existing equipment 
was an important phase in the specification, development and appre­ciation of a fully interactive, intelligent 
graphicsand data acquisition sattelite. REFERENCES [1] L. Koenigsberg, J. A. Meads, and J. Shaw, A graphics

cation program can only access the satellite through subroutine calls inthe host system. A subroutine 
call results in the creation of one or more terminal commands, which when received at the satellite, 
cause the correspondingdisplay file modification. However, the ability to control exactly when a command 
arrives at the satellite is next to impossible because of several factors: the buffering technique 
for commands in the host, the speed of the communications interface, and the operating characteristicsof 
the host system. As a result, black box satellites are predominately used for the creation of "static" 
pictures. However, a logical grouping of terminal commands, processed with some semblance of time, can 
be used to perform certain types of animation. This is especially true if the satellite operates on 
a structured display file, because certain commands are then quite powerful. One such command may cause 
attribute changes (movement,blanking,...), or the addition and deletion of graphical picture structures. 
A list of terminal commands, processed in a timed sequence by the satellite, is the basic concept of 
animations inthis paper. To have applica­ tion, however, commands must be stored at the satellite with 
the definitionand control facili­ties in the host program. The following discus­sion deals with a particular 
environment and describes the changes to the satellite software to achieve animation.  2. HOST-SATELLITEENVIRONMENT 
 The host computer is a Honeywell 635 operating under GCOS, with more than 130 remote devices con­nected 
to the system across the states. The satel­ lite system isa Sanders ADDS/900 with a Varian 620i minicomputer. 
The 620i has 12K of 16 bit word memory: 4K isrefresh memory and 8K houses the local system software. 
There isno auxilliary storage at the satellite system. Graphics programs are written in FORTRANusing 
a Graphics Subroutine Package (GSP) [2], which allows the creation of graphic data structures on a GROUP-ITEM 
basis.  3. HOST DEFINITION AND CONTROL OF ANIMATIONS An animation sequence, as defined inthis paper, 
is simply a "named" list of terminal commands. The commands can be any of those in the repertoire of 
the satellite, ranging from line drawing operations to the manipulation of the GROUPS and ITEMS of the 
display file. Normally, the terminal commands are processed as they are received at the satellite system. 
How­ever, several subprograms (Table 1), designed for the definition and control of animations, enable 
the host program to change this mode of operation. Animations are defined through the use of sub­routines 
ANMDEF and ANMEND. The body of an anima­tion, placed between them, ismerely a logical grouping of graphics 
subroutines. The result of ANMDEF isa special commandwhich switches the satellite from "processing"mode 
to "storage" mode. Subsequent commands are stored at the satellite until an "end of animation" command 
is received. The following example (Fig. 1) represents the host definition of an animation sequence named 
"SINE", which when activated,will move the graphical structure "CHAR" (the letter 'S') through the path 
of SIN(X),X=0,...,2r.  Fig. 1 - An Example of a Simple Animation Once an animation isdefined, it can 
be activated at any time. It starts when the satellite pro­cesses an "invoke animation" command, which 
is generated in the host through subroutineANMINV. However, all commands of an animation sequence can 
not be processed at once, or only the end result will be seen. This isnaturally so, because of the 
the completion of one command until the start of the next. The time is a direct multiple of the DPC rate. 
For example, if the DPC rate is 60 cycles/sec., a time of 1 implies a 1/60 second wait between commands, 
and a time of 60 is a 1 second wait. The time is specified from the host program through subroutine ANMINV. 
An extremely valuable side effect, used for program defined function keys and normal system messages, 
is that a time of zero implies full speed processing(no wait between commands). The animation example 
(Fig. 1)consists of 101 "move" commands. The statement CALL ANMINVC'SINE",30) would activate the animation 
with a 1/2 second wait between commands, thus lasting for 50.5 seconds. Once defined, an animation can 
not be changed except by a complete redefinition originating in the host. However, the remaining subprograms 
(Table 1) offer the host program the control to cover a wide variety of applications. An anima­ tion 
can activate another (ANMINV), stop another CANMSTP), and resume another (ANMRSM). Itcan also stop itself 
(ANMWT) until another is com­pleted, at which time it will automaticallybe resumed. Finally, the inter-command 
time can be changed (ANMTIM) to show acceleration or decelera­ tion.  4. PROCESSING ANIMATIONSAT THE 
SATELLITE The animation implementationrequired the following of the terminal software: 1 -Local storage 
for animation definitions. 2 -A clocking mechanism. 3--Single command processing capability. 4--Animation 
control logic. 4.1 Local Storage Since there isno auxilliary storage at the satellite,commands consituting 
all animation definitions are stored in unused main memory. This amounts to about 2K in one version of 
the software and 4K in another. The most common commands used in animations require from 2 to 4 words 
of storage each.  4.2 Clocking Mechanism A 1/60 second clock was requiredsince the DPC at the satellite 
is 60 cycles/second. To support this, the real time clock of the minicomputeris used, although a count-down 
in the main control loop of the software has proven satisfactory.  4.3 Single Command Processing speed 
of the minicomputeras related to that of one display processor cycle (DPC) or refresh cycle. In fact, 
if more than one command isprocessedwithin one DPC, some information may be lost to the viewer. Therefore, 
to control the timing of animations, the host program specifies an inter­ command time that the satellite 
should wait from The only change to the original softwarewas in a message processingmodule. Here all 
commands were processed as they were received. The input module buffered commands in an internal form, 
and passed it to the message processor which stepped through each command by calling on the appropriate 
display file modules (Fig. 2). DISPLAY FILE MODULES  Fig. 2 - Original Message Organization The previous 
organizationwas not suitable because animations require that commands be processed one at a time. 
However,normal system messages should be processedwithout any delay. The solution was to treat all 
messages as animations. To support this, the messageprocessor was changed to a command processor (handle 
one command and return), and it was given the task of storing commands during an animation definition 
(Fig. 3). An animation controller (explainedbelow)was written to process all animations, calling on 
the command processorwhen required. Finally, since all pro­cessing is designed for animations, the input 
 module defines each input buffer as an animation. However, itimmediately activates itwith an inter­command 
time of zero which results in full speed message processing.  4.4 Animation Controller Every command 
to be processed at the satellite passes through this module. It is given controlfrom either the input 
module or the system clock. All decisions are made from an internal table (Fig. 4) in which each animation 
has a six word entry, indexed by the animation name. Animation is always reserved for normal messages 
(I/Obuffer) and has its values assigned by the input module. Entries in the table are made during ani­mation 
definition (START,END), and by the specialcommands used for controlling animations (Table 2). START 
- Pointerto start of animation END - Pointer to end of animation NEXT -Pointer to next command to 
be processed ICTIME -Inter-commandwait time while an animation in process TLEFT -Time remaining until 
next com­mand is processed. Decremented with each 1/60 sec. clock when active. WAIT -Animationon whose 
completion this animation iswaiting Fig. 4 -Animation Control Information  The logic of the animation 
controller can be best described by the following flow diagram (Fig. 5). The terms used in the diagram 
are those which are defined in Figure 4. From this itcan be seen that an animationwith an inter-command 
time of zero has all commands processed in one pass through the module. Likewise,one with a time "n"requires 
"n"passes until the next command of that sequence isprocessed. Note also that animations activated in 
the same pass will be completely synchronized, since the system clock isnot reset until the end. 5. 
COMMENTS When motion isused to highlight a picture, it is sometimes advantageous to see it more than 
once, or even at different speeds. Since animation defi­nitions are stored at the satellite, they can 
be activated as many times as desired. However, if the command to activate an animation is processed 
directly from the communications line, the terminal user must be ready, because itmay start at any time. 
 It turned out that program defined function keys fit very nicely into the animation framework. The host 
program can define a function key assignment just as an animation is defined. The only change was to 
disguise the subroutine names, i.e., FKYDEF and FKYEND rather than the corresponding animation names 
ANMDEF and ANMEND. The commands sent to the satellite are exactly those which are sent for animation 
definitions, except that a unique name is assigned. Inthe satellite software, a function key depress 
interrupt causes the corresponding animation, if defined, to be activated with an inter-command time 
of zero. If the statements were included in the host program, the terminal user could activate animation 
"SINE" as often as he desires by depressing the appropriate function key. This can be extremely valuable 
inmany educational applications, and it also reduces the  Fig. 5 -Animation Controller Logic interaction 
design requirements of the host pro­gram. Function key assignments have a great value in non-animationprograms 
as well.  6. CONCLUSION A technique used for processing certain classes of animations in a host-satelliteenvironment 
has been discussed. While extending the capabilities of programs operating in this environment, the system 
has also maintained its original identity in support of on-going and non-animation applica­tion programs. 
In fact, the satellite has remained a black box system, since the only real change was in the satellites 
view of processing messages. The total implementationrequired only 200 additional words of logic in the 
satellite software. The primary limitation, as to the complexity and number of animations, is the amount 
of free memory available for their definitions. However, rather significant results have been achievedwith 
anima­tion applications in an educational environment. Certain applications include: viewing the flow 
of information through a mock computer, flow of infor­mation through a multiprogrammedcomputersystem, 
viewing a queueing model in action, and viewing several non-linearoptimization techniques via gradient 
search vectors. Not only have the appli­cations been valuable for hands-on use, but they have greatly 
simplified the creation of video tape presentationsfor classroom purposes. REFERENCES [1] Griffith Hamlin,

 A SYSTEM FOR INTERACTIVE ACQUISITION AND ADMINISTRATIONOF GEOMETRIC DATA FOR THEMATIC MAP PRODUCTION 
 Klaus TUERKE Bundesforschungsanstaltfuer Landeskunde und Raumordnung, Bonn -Bad Godesberg, Federal Republic 
of Germany Most computer assisted information systems for planning purposes are designed to produce 
thematic maps as output. Graphic data processing, on the other hand, has not yet reached the degree of 
perfection already achieved in other fields of EDP, e.g. commercial and statistical applications. The 
author and his colle­ gues are integrating cartographic data and presentation techniques gradually into 
an information system. Within the system being described, the geometric data base is considered as a 
 line network. The edges of the network are represented by strings of orthogonal coordinates (Segment 
definitions). A unique identifieris assigned to each coordi­nate string, and the areal units are defined 
by a sequence of edge identifiers (Polygon definitions).  In order to obtain error-free files, strict 
rules have to be observed and a high degree of accuracy has to be achieved. For this purpose, an interactive 
system -DIGNET -has been developed to full­fill these objectives: (1) guide the operator through the 
digitizing session, (2) ask for the appropriate input, (3) create the reference tables, (4) react to 
erroneous input  and operation, (5) detect digitizer malfunctions, (6) allow immediate graphic replay 
of the digitized data. In order to facilitate the manipulation of the boundary network files, a number 
of utility programs have been added to the DIGNET-System; among them  (1) DIGEDI -to prepare maps for 
digitzing, (2) DIGLIST -to list all results from digitizing sessions,(3) DIGMERGE ­  to merge two or 
more submaps into one final map.  1. AUTOMATION IN THEMATIC MAP PRODUCTION The "Bundesforschungsanstaltfuer 
Landes­kunde und Raumordnung" (BfLR) is an insti­tution devoted to research and continu­ ous observation 
of spatial development in the Federal Republic of Germany. One of the most important activities of the 
 BfLR is the development and maintenance if a spatially oriented information system (see Fig. 1). Thematic 
maps as output from this system play an important part in presenting facts and trends in spatial development. 
 This paper will give a description of an application system for the inter­active acquisition and administration 
of area boundary networks. It might be interesting at this point to describe the special properties 
of thema­tic maps and the context within which they are required in a spatially oriented infor­ mation 
system. Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work or personal or classroom

graphy exclusively with topographic map production. Topographic cartographers intend to store an almost 
complete inven­tory of all and everything that can be found on the earth's surface an a map ­be it on 
the analog paper map or in digi­tal form on electronic media. Maps in general can be used to serve one 
or more of the following three main func­tions: -Store information about phenomena in space (storage 
function);  -Aide the researcher to enlarge his know­ledge and initiate new concepts about the spatial 
distribution of phenomena in space (analysis function); -Transmit facts and concepts about space in 
an easy to read medium to people interested in such information (transmissionfunction) (cf.Ganser [3]. 
 154  Reports, programs, information for parliament, government, public. Note: This is a rough outline 
of the elements involved; note escecially that acquisition, analysis and presentation interact with 
each other in a  feedback process and thus cannot be separated so easily. Fig. 1: Elements in Elements 
in a Spatially Oriented Information System a Spatially Oriented Information System Thematic maps are 
primarily used as a  transmission medium, being a powerful tool for presenting spatially distributed 
 phenomena. The thematic cartographer is in a position to condense information and display it in such 
a way that the user can perceive the message intended by the author of the map within one or a few 
instants. The same information in written form whould require a lot of explanatory text and still 
suffer from the shortsomings of language as a sequential, one-dimensional  medium describing two or 
moredimensional phenomena. Bertin in his brilliant book on the system of graphic semiology [1] has stressed 
the advantages of graphic media to offer human perception a 'direct access' to spatial relations. Consequently 
 most computer assisted infor­mation systems for planning purporses are designed to produce cartographic 
output. Graphic data processing on the other hand has not yet reached the degree of perfec­tion already 
achieved in other fields of EDP, e.g. commercial and statistical appli­ cation fields. The implementation 
of computer aided tech­niques in automatic thematic map produc­tion has proven to be much more complica­ 
ted than optimists hoped -and some con­ventional cartographers might have feared -ten or twenty years 
ago. The vision of pusing a button at one end of a black box and obtaining a complete, ready-to-use 
map at the other has long vanished. We know today that the so called  computer map in the near future 
will be a map interactively chosen under the visual control of cartographers, assisted by sophisticated 
graphic data processing equipment and software (Hessdorfer [5]). The problem at our agency has been 
to mix as much computer assistance as reasonable  and economical while allowing a maximum of opportunities 
for the cartographer to intervene in the various steps of thematic map production in order to obtain 
optimal final results. Consequently in the last years we have gradually increased the computer assistance 
within the process of data acquisition, data management, analy­sis of numeric data and output of thematic 
maps. It is evident that a modular, semi­automatic system consisting of many fairly independent subsystem 
can only work with strict and well defined rules for the different data bases required for final output. 
 2. HARDWARE CONFIGURATION Currently the major parts of the BfLR hardware confuguration are -a PDP 
11/45 master-computerwith 60 k Within the system being described,the geo­ words core, fixed -head and 
moving-head metrical data base defining areal units is disk, several tape devices and I/O ter­ considered 
as a boundary line network. The minals;  edges of the network -the lines between -a PDP 11/20 slave 
processor driving di­tizier and plotter; -a table plotter CalComp 738 on line/off line; -graphic terminal 
Tektronix 4002 A with keyboard and joystick for graphic input; -digitizer d-mac pencil follower with 
 CAMAC-interface also handling function buttons and acoustical/opticalindi­cators;  and several smaller 
devices supporting the operator-machine dialog: -a 32-character alphanumeric display; -16 input function 
buttons; -8 indicator lamps; -8 acoustical alarms; -computer-controlledcassette recorder for acoustical 
output. 3. GEOMETRIC DATA BASE ORGANIZATION There are three different types of geo­ metric data relevant 
for thematic maps: p o i n t s representing the location of places; -i n e s that stand for communicat­ion 
links between places; and -closed p o l y g o n s defining areas. For a number of reasons, area oriented 
net­word are of special interest in computer­assisted cartography: -One of the most efficient presentation 
techniques in thematic cartography are choropleth maps expressing the magni­tude of a quantitative variable 
for each area by different shading and/or coloring. These provide for an easy to read image of the spatial 
distribut­ ion of the phenomena under observation. -Most people are able to identify locat­ions by the 
shape of their administra­tive area ) on a map. Even on maps using point or line symbols, area outlines 
are often used as a background. -Digitized area boundary networks allow for further geometrical computation 
like calculation of areas and centers of gravity, or Helmer transformations, or distortions of the surface 
according to variables other then spatial distances (time, accessibility). *)Gould and White [4,p.119ff]are 
more sceptical about the layman's ability to identify area boundaries.They still admit that "people 
confuse adjancent states sometimes, but they often know roughly where they are". two nodes -are represented 
by strings of orthogonal coordinates. A unique identifier is assigned to each of these coordinate strings, 
and the areal units are defined by a sequence of edge identifiers. The sign of these identifiersindicates 
the direction of the coordinate string relative to each areal unit. The boundary network data base consists 
of two types of files: -The neighboring lines between two areas (s e g m e n t s ) are digitized only 
once and stored as separate coordinates, in a "segment definition file" (SDF)  -P o l y g o n s are 
defined by their identification code and stored in the "polygon definition file" (PDF) as a set of references 
to segment numbers. To clarify the data organization used )),we will take as simplified sample area 
con­ structed for demonstration (fig. 2) and an example from the County Boundaries of Germany (Kreisgrenzenkarte1970, 
fig. 3). In the demonstration map, Acounty (001) is defined by the segment 1, 2 and 3. The actual coordinates 
can be taken from the segment definition list (the unit is 0.1 mm). Acounty and Ceecounty (003) share 
segment 3. The sequence of the coordinates is clockwise for Acounty, counterclockwise for Ceecounty 
(note the opposite signs for the same segment in the two polygon defi­nitions). Likewise the Counties 
of Dith­ marschen and Nordfriesland in fig. 3 share segment 13. Some logical and geometrical problems 
of digitzing areal boundaires arise from the fact that boundaries in Central Europe habe grown historically 
rather than having been drafted on an engineer's desk as in many parts of the US and Canada. For example, 
one minor problem is the di­gitizing of several polygons belonging to one administrative area, e.g. 
islands like the one belonging to Acounty (fig. 2),or exclaveslike the city of Bremerhaven, which is 
part of the administration unit of Bre­men (cf. fig. 3). Enclaves, on the other hand, are rather complicated 
to define. Consider the situation of Beecity and Cee­county (fig. 2) or the city and the county of Luneburg 
(lower right part of fig. 3). The city is situated completely within the county boundaires. If these 
outer bounda­ries were to be used exclusively to define the county, errors whould occur in further **)

in­formation systems.  SIGGRRPH DEMO   Fig. 2: DIGNET example areas  Fig. 3: Kreisgrenzenkarte 
1970 (example areas)  processing because they do not exclude the city boundaries. The solution is an 
auxiliary semgent (C), connecting the outer segments with the inner boundary, thus defining a ring shaped 
area linked at C. 4. DIGNET-A SYSTEM FOR DIGITIZING BOUNDARY NETWORKS In order to obtain network files 
with a minimum of errors, strict rules have to be observed and a high degree of accuracy must be achieved. 
With off-line digitizing procedures a considerable amount of post­processing and updating is necessary 
to correct the numerous errors possible: missing segments, faulty reference tables for areal units, 
missing coincidence of segment endpoints etc. The overcome these shortcomings an inter­active system*) 
has been developed to fullfill the following objectives: -initialize a specific map for digitizing, 
 -ask for the appropriate input, -create the reference tables, -react to erroneous input and operations, 
 -detect digitizer malfunctions, -allow immediate graphic replay of the digizited data, -do file handling 
and processing with minor operator intervention. Digitizing necessitates considerable concentration 
and visual stress on the operator. The system is designed to give the operator as many aids as possible, 
making his work comfortable and therefore error-minimizing.A short description of the digitizing procedure 
may give an im­pression of how this concept has been realized (cf. fig. 4). First, the DIGNET utility 
program is run. This map editor interactively creates an entry in a directory file for the map to be 
processed. It generates a file con­taining the area identifications, calcula­tes the number of disc blocks 
necessary for the several workfiles etc. Among other things the operator defines a code name for the 
map. Then the main program DIGNET is started. The operator only gives the code name of the map; the 
system handles all the files automatically. In the next step, DIGNET prompts the operator to input the 
coordi­nates of the map origin (map zero) and two reference points on the X-and Y-axes, *)A.R.Boyle,the 
leading worker in the field of both interactive and automatic digitizing, described an interactive digitizing 
system in a hydrographic charting context [2, p. 524 f] respectively. The rotation of the map is defined 
by the first of these points. In subsequent digitizing sessions, the system checks for coincidence 
of the reference points with the ones previously recorded. DIGNET then outputs the name of the first 
 area to be digitized on the log device (teletype) and a small 32-character display mounted on the 
digitizer within the field of vision of the operator (RT 02). Whenever the input button is pushed, 
the current coordinates are recorded and echoed on the graphic display. Thus the operator can monitor 
the points already recorded. When the new coordinates refer to a point outside the portion of the map 
 visible on the screen, the system automa­ tically places the new point into the center and replays 
all coordinates recor­ ded. At points where three or more areas meet, the NODE button is pushed to 
tell the system that one segment should be termina­ ted and a new one started. If the node is already 
recorded, a warning message is given in case the operator is trying to digitize a segment already recorded. 
 The FOLLOW buttonmustbe pushedto copy one or more segments previously input into the polygon definition 
of the current area. The operator then only digitizes the coor­ dinates of the first and the last points 
 in the sequence. Error messages occur when either an original node cannot be found within a certain 
tolerance radius of the point input, or when there is no path leading from the starting point to the 
 final one. It is the operator's option to try again or return to the system state before the button 
was pushed. Closing the polygon is effected by pushing the END POLYGON button and re-digitizing either 
the initial coordinates of the poly­ gon or the beginning node of a sequence of already known segments 
leading to the be­ ginning. END POLYGON is used for all but the last polygon in a set of multiple polygons 
belonging to one administration area. The last (or only) polygon of an area is closed by END AREA. 
After storing the previous definitions, DIGNET moves on to the next area. Some special functions are 
included to: -replay all coordinates recorded on the screen, -Redefine origin and skewing whenever 
the position of the map on the digitizer has been changed on purpose or accidentially (or by digitizer 
malfunction), -remove the last coordinates recorded from the segment definition, -define another resolution 
tolerance for picking up nodes previously recorded, -terminate a DIGNET session. 158   Prepare a 
map for digitizing (define file names, allocate disc blocks, enter documentation) Digitizationof areas

segments an updating of the associated polygon file Fig. 4: DIGNET system components: A. Main program 
hardware environment B. Utilities  Optical and acoustical channels keep the operator informed on system 
events. The output of the area identification and the graphical echo of the point recorded last have 
been mentioned above. Small lamps in the operator's field of vision and acou­ stical signals of different 
pitch, durat­ ion and quality respond to the operator's action or ask for special reactions. E.g. recording 
of a simple coordinate is ack­ nowledged by a low pitched acoustical signal; identification of node 
by a sonorous bell; error and warning messages are accompanied by several loud signals. The lamps are 
mainly used to show "system ready for input" and/or "special func­tion". A small example may clarify 
the inter­ action between operator and system. The operator wants to close a polygon follo­ wing a path 
over several segments previously recorded. He pushes function button "END AREA". DIGNET turns on the 
corresponding lamp plus the READY light to show it is waiting for input. When the coordinate input button 
is pushed, the READY light disappears and DIGNET is trying to solve the closing problem. If the search 
for the closing point of the polygon is succesful, the bell is rung, DIGNET closes the polygon definition, 
 displays the identification of the next area and returns to the READY state. When the search fails, 
errors are flagged by loud acoustical signals and an error message (either "No node to follow/comple­te" 
or "No path to initial coordinates"); DIGNET returns to the state preceding the wrong input. The DIGNET 
main program uses a number of temporary direct access workfiles. To increase the portability of the 
geometric data base, the final system output should be sequential ASCII files. The DIGLST utility program 
can create a pair of sequential polygon/segment definition files, list the current state of any map 
in the directory file -directory entry, segment, polygon and node information in the workfiles -on the 
line printer and output the digitized segments on the plot­ter. Thus the operator can obtain a hard­copy 
of the work he has done that can be compared with the original map and searched for digitizing errors. 
 Another valuable facility of the system is the merge program -DIGMRG -that combines two pairs of polygon/segment 
files by de­leting subsequent versions of neighboring segments, renumbering the segments and up­dating 
the output polygon file. Fig. 5 shows, how a submap of the areas Deeplace and Endtown can be merged 
with the example map on Fig. 2 to form a final pair of segment/polygon files. The merge option can be 
used for two purposes: -Experience has shown, that an operator is able to digitize for about 2 hours 
with a low error rate; after that the error  rate goes up considerably. Therefore larger maps are segmented 
into submaps. of 30 -50 areas that are handled by the system as independent directory entries. We found 
out that operators prefer to know that previous submaps are secure againstall the possible hardships 
of EDP -system crashes, digitizer malfunc­tions, disc errors etc. -; the worst that can happen is another 
two hours digitizing session for the current map. The problem of updating the boundary files can be 
solved easely using the DIGMRG program. Polygons that have to be changed must simply be deleted out of 
the polygon definition file and pre­pared for digitizing in an independent submap. This new map containing 
the up­dated segments is then merged with the old map. 5. SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS The general concept 
for acquisition and development of software in the BfLR has been to gain as much independence from hardware 
configurationand operating systems as possible. In particular, FORTRAN IV has been chosen as a language 
usable on almost every computer to establish a high degree of system inde­pendence. Handling an "exotic" 
peripheral like the digitizer, on the other hand, necessitates programming on the assembler and/or system 
programming level. The basic program functions to monitor the digitizer are:  LAMPON,LAMPOF control 
the acoustical and BEEPON,BEEPOF optical signals. These routines are FORTRAN callable and may be used 
by any FORTRAN program. In connection with the first major pro­duction, the digitizing of the Kreisgren­zenkarte 
1970 (County Boundaries), ex­periences could be gathered to improve the data organization and human enginee­ring 
of the digitizing environment. The DIGNET system itself -known formerly as CADS (Computer Aided Digitizing 
System) -was first tested in several assembler versions under the DOS operating system. Most parts have 
been re-written in FORT- RAN IV and tested within in a new multi­ programming system (RSX-11M). 161 
 6. FIELDS OF APPLICATION OF BOUNDARY NETWORK FILES When several areas are added together to form 
new units we speak of graphical aggregation. For example, all the outward boundaries of communities 
belonging to one county form the county boundary; the district boundaries can be formed out of the 
county boundaries etc. Graphical aggregation of areas defined by polygon and segment references (as 
used in the DIGNET output) is comparatively easy. The new aggregates can be defined by explicit refrences 
("area D is formed by areas A, B and C"). Aggregation of areas on the different levels of an administrat­ 
ive hierarchy can be much facilitated by the structure of area identificationnum­bers used. The official 
German identifi­ cation numbers consist of eight digits: two digits defining the federal state, one 
for the district, two for the county and three for the community. E.g. to find the areas belonging to 
one Regierungsbezirk (governmentaldistrict) of the Federal Republic, it is sufficient to look at the 
 first three digits of the area identifi­ cation numbers. The graphical aggregation itself is per­ formed 
by searching the polygon definition file for those segment definitions that occur once for all members 
of the new aggregate; these segments are identical with the outer boundaries of the new area. There 
is one minor problem with graphical aggregation: High level aggregates like the boundaries of the federal 
states are generally used for small scale maps. Be­ cause they are based an a "base" map consisting 
of comparatively small units, the border lines of the aggregate contain too much detail. For this case 
we have developed programs to reduce the number of boundary coordinates in small scale maps, thus saving 
storage and processing/ output time. The value of the geometrical data base is dependent on how well 
it is integrated into the BfLR information system for spa­ tial analysis and how often it is used to 
present research results in thematic maps. The production of the Atlas of the Federal Republic of Germany 
(Part. II) can be regarded as a first test to integrating automatic methods into a process of designing 
and producing thematic maps. During the last years numerous maps have been plotted for this purpose. 
The main technical applications were: -automatic classification of data into groups, and plotting of 
the results using different shades and colors; -color separation and scribing of the area outlines for 
conventional repro­duction and printing techniques. A more integrated approach to computer aided design 
and execution of thematic maps is currently being realized at our agency in form of an interactive system 
that combines data analysis and automatic mapping techniques (Hessdorfer [5]). REFERENCES [1] Bertin,

 THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERCOLOR 8000 TERMINAL TO THEMATIC CARTOGRAPHY James R. Carter Department 
of Geography and David J. Icove Department of Electrical Engineering University of Tennessee Knoxville, 
Tennessee 37916 The Intercolor 8000 color video terminal is used in conjunction with a timesharing computer 
system for applications in thematic cartography. The version of the terminal discussed can resolve the 
screen into a matrix of 25 rows by 80 columns with colored characters on colored backgrounds. Using 
the plot mode, the screen can be further resolved into single-color cells of 100 rows by 160 columns. 
The value and limitations of the terminal are discussed in terms of the selection and brightness of 
the eight colors, the dimensions of the cells and the ability to mix colors in small cells. The possibilities 
 of using the terminal for dot, choropleth and isarithmic maps are explored. Acetate overlays can be 
 used to add base lines such as boundaries and rivers and the composite images can be recorded on stand­ 
ard slide film. 1. INTRODUCTION The Intercolor 8000 is a microprocessor-based color CRT terminal developed 
by Intelligent Systems Corporation for use with timeshare and minicomputer systems. The terminal has 
limited graphics capa­bility and is able to present displays in combinat­ions of eight colors, including 
black and white. The terminal is available with either an Intel 8008 or 8080 microprocessorwhich is entirely 
dedicated to the maintenance of the color display. A large proportion of the displays can be initiated 
from the keyboard with the display assisted only by the microprocessor. The terminal was purchased by 
the Department of Geography, University of Tennessee, to serve as a timeshare terminal as well as to 
provide a new medium to develop interactive student teaching packages and applicationsin thematic cartography. 
The terminal is now linked to the University DEC System-10 through a RS-232-C interface and a Bell Telephone 
modem.  2. THE TERMINAL The basic terminal is available assembled or as a kit. A number of options 
are also available on the unit. See Table 1. The terminal uses a 19-inch color television screen and 
the illuminated image measures 12.0 inches by 8.5 inches (30.5 cm by 21.6 cm). There is no hard-copy 
unit available to complement the system,but the image is bright enough to allow photographs to be taken 
directly from the screen with standard slide films. Red and blue, however, are darker than the other 
colors. Exposures taken in darkness from the full screen swept in single colors revealed that the red 
and blue are two f-stops darker than the lighter colors. Permission to make digital or hard copies of 
part or all of this work or personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are 
not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full 
citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, to republish, to post on servers, or to redistribute to 
lists, requires prior 163 specific permission and/or a fee. Siggraph 76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
 The screen is refreshed at a rate of 60 times per second. Most photographs will be taken at speeds 
 slower than 1/60 of a second so that more than one sweep will be recorded on the film. In almost all 
 photographs taken from the screen at a variety of speeds, a light band can be seen extending horizon­ 
tally across the image. In most cases this band has not been so bright as to materially detract from 
the image. The standard display is made up of an 80 by 25 character matrix. With the background option 
any of the 8 colors may be selected for the background, and any color may be used to portray the foreground. 
At this level of resolution the terminal is no different than most CRT terminals, except for the ability 
to display a multitude of colors. In the standard display each character position or cell has a height 
to width ratio of 2.25:1 or 9:4. Any graphic pattern generated with these cells will have more than 
twice the resolution along the hori­zontal axis than along the vertical axis. The plot mode gives the 
basis of the limited graph­ ics capability of the terminal. This mode breaks the standard character 
into a 2 by 4 matrix of smaller cells. Thus, the 80 by 25 matrix is broken into a 160 by 100 matrix, 
as seen in Figure 1.  Fig. 1 -Sketch showing the two levels of resolution on the Intercolor 8000. 
On the left, alphanumeric and density characters; on the right, the smallest addressable cells using 
the plot mode. Each of the smaller cells is nearly square, having a height to width ratio of 1.125:1 
or 9:8. These smaller cells can only be saturated with a single color, for there are no characters 
that may be assigned to these smaller cells. Once the terminal is placed in the plot mode, a cell is 
illuminated with the foreground color upon receipt of the row­ column coordinates. The microprocessor 
continues to illuminate cells with each pair of row-column coordinates received.  To change colors, 
the plot mode is exited, the colors changed, and the plot mode re-established. The ability to resolve 
a matrix of 160 by 100 with eight colors leads to a number of graphic possibili­ ties. However, the terminal 
is designed so that each small cell is treated as a member of its larger from the 80 by 25 matrix; and 
within each large cell  it is possible to have only two colors--the back­ground and the foreground color. 
Thus 3, 4 or more colors cannot appear in juxtapositionin a 2 by 4 matrix making up a large cell. For 
if in the plot mode the background is set to white, the lower left cell of the larger cell is set to 
blue, and the foreground is then set to red and the upper right cell is called to be displayed in red, 
the lower left cell will also come up red although it was originally defined as blue. There is no way 
to  increase the memory of the terminal so that both red and blue small cells could be displayed on 
a white background within the larger cell. This fact  164 imposes a severe limitation on the application 
of the terminal to cartography and all graphics. 3. CARTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS Thematic cartography 
is the branch of cartography that deals with mapping data on a particular theme. Items that may be mapped 
range from voting behavior water consumption, and crime statistics to levels of income and the type 
of vegetation. The thematic map may take many forms. This terminal provides a way to display thematic 
data processed by the computer in a manner unavailable with any other hardware at this price, although 
it is likely that similar color displays may become available in the near future [1]. As of this writing 
there are no computer programs available for this terminal--either mapping pro­grams or general purpose 
programs. We are develop­ing subroutines and programs to handle mapping situations. In the process we 
have been able to access the value of the terminal for mapping purposes and have developed some approaches 
to making the CRT displays more effective as thematic maps. The small cells can be joined to make lines, 
but these lines are so coarse that they still look like a string of small blocks. Because the cells are 
not square, simple diagonals are not at 45 ° to the cardinal orientations. In general, the crude lines 
that can be constructed on this terminal with this resolution appear to have no utility for carto­ graphy. 
But most thematic map applications need base lines to indicate boundaries, roads and streams to provide 
the reader with the redundancy necessary to give meaning to the information in the map. It has been found 
that this base data can be added to the CRT display by attaching acetate overlays to the screen. The 
brightness of the display allows the user to differentiate colors on an acetate overlay so that, if desired, 
streams could be shown in blue and boundaries in black. Given the ability to display cells at two levels 
of resolution, in a variety of colors for both foregroundand background, and viewed through an overlay 
which may be quite detailed and multicolor­ ed, three types of maps can be made on this terminal. 1. 
The dot map: This map type shows the occur­rence of an event or item at a point. The pattern shows a 
density in terms of dots per area. On this terminal the resolution of the dots is fixed by the 160 by 
100 matrix. At this scale there are a maximum of 16,000 addressable locations on the screen, which 
should give a relatively decent representationof most data. 2. The choropleth map: This map type is 
based on a fixed areal unit of data collection, such as a county, state or census tract. The data class 
is portrayed by a symbol or color applied evenly over the areal unit. Most choropleth maps have the 
data aggregated into 3 to 8 class­es of generalizationbecause this is the maxi­ mum number of levels 
the eye can discern in gray tones given our ability to select patterns. Tobler [2] has shown how the 
plotter can construct patterns that are proportional to the actual values so that the data do not have 
to be aggregated into classes. Using the set of dens­ ity characters in the Intercolor 8000 it should 
 be possible to display a large gradation of color combinations so that the choroplethmaps are essentially 
maps without classes. This could occur only when the maps are made with the 80 by 25 matrix. 3. The 
isarithmic map: This map type portrays a smooth, continuous surface formed by such variables as elevation, 
temperature and populat­ion density. Values are given at a few points, and the surface is derived by 
interpolation between the known points. There are many ways to perform the interpolation. On this terminal, 
 the isarithmic surface can be shown with the large cells using the full range of characters to get 
a continuum of shadings. The purpose of the continuum is to have a range of color com­binations which 
give the impression of a smooth range of categories from high to low. This is the same continuum we would 
seek fro the class­less choroplethmaps.  Many applications of thematic cartography are designed around 
a cell [3]. Such maps might be classed as dot and/or choroplethmaps. As dot maps they show an occurrence 
or non-occurrenceat a point--the point being the cell. As choropleth maps they show data by classes 
assigned to fixed areas--the areas being the cells. Baxter, et. al. [4] uses rectangular cells of two 
basic sizes to map environmentaldata for land use analysis. These cells are a function of the geographic 
grid. At the latitude where most of this work is done, a unit of longitude is 0.8 times the length of 
a unit of longitude. The cells for data collection have the same dimensions and are conveniently represented 
by a single character on the line printer. Carter [5] designed an urban map using square cells based 
on units 500 feet to the side. Icove [6] used cells in a hierarchy to map incidences of fire events. 
In the hierarchy the smaller cells were square, but larger cells were longer than they were wide. These 
examples were noted to illustrate that there are many thematic map applicationswhich use cells as the 
basic unit of data collection and display. However, almost all schemes use cells with a height to width 
ratio different from the dimensions obtained with this terminal. To apply any of these existing data 
sets to the terminal display will require compromise. Probably the easiest compromise can be achieved 
by stretching the base overlay along one axis. In all of the cases noted above, the distortion would 
be small and probably not recognizable by most users. For any new mapping situations, the dimensions 
of the cells for data aggregation might be selected to fit the terminal, if that were deemed important. 
If the cells of data collectionwere designed to coincide with the dimensions of the cells on the terminal, 
the cells of data collectionwould be distorted if ever displayed on a line printer.  4. MAPPING WITH 
THE 160 BY 100 MATRIX When small cells are used for the level of presen­ tation there are only two colors 
that may be contained within a larger cell. Using these small­er cells the cartographer is limited to 
a basic dot map showing the presence or absence of an attribute. More than one color of small cell can 
be used on the same map if the attributes displayed with the different colors do not exist near each 
other. There will be few instances where this situation can be guaranteed and for this reason we have 
not attempted to create a program to produce these maps. If the final product is a photograph of the 
CRT image, then it is possible to produce a map with the full range of colors applied at the finer resolution 
by taking multiple exposures of the image. This must be done in a dark room or under a hood so that the 
reflection off the screen is not recorded on each exposure. While it is a nuisance to shoot multiple 
exposures, as well as being tricky, it does give the opportunity to set the proper exposure as each 
color is displayed. A program has been designed to display each color separately against a black background. 
The major disadvantage is that the cartographer cannot see the final product until the film is developed. 
Along the same line, it should be possible to use the terminal and a 35 mm camera for the creation of 
"micro-graphic"separationplates for color print­ ing. This might prove to be a cheap way to imitate 
the micrographics work done by the U. S. Bureau of the Census [7]. No attempt has been made at this time 
to create plates and print a map using slides taken from this terminal. By combining the CRT display 
with a transparent overlay of base data and the multiple exposures of the camera a relatively fine resolution 
display can be produced in many colors. This approachmight have value to show something like false alarms, 
arson, and non-arson fires on a single map. The eight colors would allow for all possible combina­tions 
of these three variables, including the null set. The colors presented as solid cells do not form a 
 series which gives the impressionof a continuum. This means that it is not possible to give a good image 
of intensity at the cell resolution of 160 by 100 cells. Thus, if arson is being mapped at this scale, 
white could be used to represent the area with the lowest incidence level, cyan the next level, then 
yellow, green, blue, magenta, and red respectively for the areas with the greatest incidence. Black 
may be reserved for the null area. The problem is that this combination of colors does not form a sequence 
such that everyone would realize that red is highest, blue is inter­mediate, and yellow is relatively 
low. No combination of the full set of colors forms a sequence. The small cell matrix has a respectable 
level of resolution but with the inability to juxtapose the full range of colors there are few ways 
the terminal can be used to generate thematic maps. Even if the juxtapositionproblem were solved, the 
 lack of good color sequences would detract from the applicabilityof the terminal for mapping most items 
people want to map. 165  5. MAPPING WITH THE 80 BY 25 MATRIX The terminal does have some mapping applications 
at the coarser level of resolution. At this scale the cells are far from square but by displaying charac­ 
ters in one color on a background of another color, a fine gradation of patternscan be created and the 
 stepped appearance minimized. A smooth gradation can be realized only when the data reflect a pattern 
 with broad changes. When the spatial patterns of the data contain steep or abrupt changes, the angular 
character of the display will be emphasized. Perhaps the greatest advantage of this terminal is the 
ability to show on an output device areas above or below some central tendency. Quite often in the analysis 
of spatial data one wants to map the mean and departures from the mean. In black and white presentations 
there is no way to have an effective gray tone to represent positive departures and another gray tone 
to represent negative de­partures. On this terminal three colors can be combined to produce a graded 
series. The central tendency is indicated by an intermediate neutral color. Cuff [8] has shown that 
the choice and argangement of colors has considerable impact on the way the map reader assigns the colors 
to the data. From our experiences it would appear that the only three-color sequences that might be effective 
are: blue-yellow-red blue-white-red blue-green-yellow blue-magenta-red blue-cyan-white At this 
time no attempt has been made to test the relative value of these color sequences. It does appear to 
be impossible to find an effective four­color sequence from this combination of light colors. Using 
a three-color sequence, Carter is attempting to make a dynamic presentationof the patterns of moisture 
status conditions for the southeastern United States. Moisture status is an index of how wet or dry 
an area is. The index is based on a departure from a central tendency so it is appropriate to make 
this presentation with a three-color sequence. In this case, red is being used for-the driest situation, 
blue for the wettest, and yellow to represent the central tendency. The map pattern is generated by an 
 interpolation subroutinewhich will find data for all cells based on the known values. The base data 
showing boundaries and coastlines will be recorded on an acetate overlay. The portion of the display 
extending out over the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico will be washed in cyan, while the continental 
area outside of the study area will be shown as a solid white. The dynamic aspect of the study will come 
about as month after month are displayed in sequence on the terminal. To record the transition from month 
to month, successive images will be photographedwith a movie camera using single frame exposures.  
6. CONCLUSIONS The Intercolor 8000 does have some applicability to cartography. The terminal has only 
limited graphics capabilities so it should not be considered as a substitute for a full-graphics terminal. 
The color capability will prove advantageous in some mapping situations, but there does not seem to 
be any situation where all colors will be utilized on a single display. The coarseness of the cells 
on this model of the terminal makes it impractical to map linear features. The utility of the terminal 
can be extended by using acetate overlays to portray base data such as roads, rivers, and boundaries. 
Hard copy output is not available, but the image can be recorded on film. A range of photographic techniques 
can be employed to create a number of cartographic pro­ducts. A variety of subroutines and mapping programs 
are being written which make the terminal a functional, though limited, tool for cartographers. The 
 attractive packaging and low price will probably result in many terminals being purchased for mapping 
 activities. It is hoped that all potential users will realize the advantages and disadvantagesof employing 
this terminal or any similar terminal for the presentationand analysis of spatial data. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

on the purchase, installation and programming of this terminal. REFERENCES [1] Lancaster, D., "TV Color

 Capture and encoding of cartographic data for machine processing is a major issue in the design and 
development of geographic information systems. Data capture technology --manual coding, digi­tizing, 
scanning --and formats --pixels, cells, grid units, points, line segments, or polygons -­constitute a 
bewildering array of choices for system designers. The system designer is faced with selecting data capture 
technology, a format that provides a capability to meet user appli­ cations, and a data processing system 
that is commensurate with the choice of data format and volume of data. Cartographic applications 
require data formats that more closely capture the fidelity of source data. Yet, some degree of spatial 
aggregation is necessary for inclusion in geographic information systems. Dr. Dueker is Director of 
the Institute of Urban and Regional Research and Professor of Urban and Regional Planning and Geography, 
University of Iowa. Support of the Energy and Environmental Systems Division, Argonne National Laboratory 
(ANL) is gratefully acknowledged. ANL work performed under the auspices of the Office of Land Use and 
Water Planning, U.S. Department of the Interior under InteragencyAgreement P7434A. There is no easy 
choice with respect to fidelity requirements for data capture or the appropriate level of aggregation 
of data. Too little is known as to the data requirements for planning and cartographic applications and 
the data capture and manipulation technology for large­scale applications. A region consists of spatially 
varying sets of characteristics. In this paper, each set is considered a coverage, say soils, and each 
coverage is categorized, say into soil classes. In other words, geographic data is considered to consist 
of various areas of like character­istics separated by networks of lines. A single such partitioning 
of a region into non-over­ lapping zones will be referred to as a coverage (1). For example, there may 
be coverages showing soil characteristics, land uses, vegetation cover type, political division, or 
combinations of these. Linear data, such as streams, roadways, railroads, can also be con­sidered a coverage, 
but with the emphasis on the network of lines rather than the bounded areas. This paper is concerned 
only with coverages as two dimensional objects, thus excluding pictorial representationof the three spatial 
dimensions as well as time-varyingpictorial information, e.g., on-line character recognition. This 
restriction  also rules out picture processing, computer gen­erated movies, and computer typography. 
Finally this paper treats the subject of coverages from a primarily problem oriented rather than tech­nique 
oriented standpoint, in that the emphasis is on the relationship between encoding coverages and applications, 
rather than hardware/software techniques for encoding coverages.  With grid data it is a simple matter 
to compare the characteristics of a point on two coverages. The most troublesome characteristicof grid 
 encoding is its approximation of coverages. Accuracy is directly linked to the size of the grid cell 
and precise replication of a coverage requires a large number of infinitesimally small cells. The first 
section of this paper discusses geo­ coding options for encoding coverages. Then the data capture, formatting, 
storage and output of coverages is related by analogy to information theory for purposes of illuminating 
parallels between encoding spatial data and encoding messages for transmission, receiving and use. 
 This analogy proves useful in that it identifies the dilemma of system designers, in that fidelity 
 requirements for the spatial processing have not been developed and consequently effectiveness measures 
for the encoding of coverage data cannot be specified. Next, the paper attempts to identify the potential 
for error in data capture so that system designers can be alert to situa­ tions that can occur and make 
allowances for remedying these errors, and the development of effectiveness measures and means to compare 
 different systems. Finally, the paper calls for the development of comparative benchmark tests that 
agencies could employ to evaluate vendor systems.  2. OVERLAYING COVERAGES A coverage can be encoded 
as a one-dimensional representationin which the basic record is a single contiguous homogeneous tract 
or "polygon" coded by locating the boundary as a series of connecting points and by indicating the 
char­ acter or descriptor of the enclosed territory.* Ignoring any error in the drawing of boundaries 
or in ascribing characteristics, the accuracy of polygon encoding is limited only by the pre­cision with 
which boundaries can be coded as series of connective points. One disadvantage of the polygon method 
occurs when two coverages have to be compared. With polygon data it is time consuming to identify the 
polygon in which a certain point lies, and thus its characteris­ tics, and to compare the same point 
on another coverage. The advantages of organizing the data so that the character of any location can 
be retrieved quickly, often leads to gridding polygon data prior to overlaying or the initial adoption 
of a grid data structure. In a grid structure the coverage is encoded by recording the nature of each 
of a series of cells ordered in some conventional sequence. Compression of grid data structure is possible 
to eliminate a data set containing a separate entry for each cell by means of using some form of multiplier 
convention for sequences of repetitious cells.  Both polygon and grid cell encoding are widely used. 
The polygon form is adopted by systems whose major concern is data storage and accurate cartographic 
retrieval, and the measurement of area. The grid system is more widely used in various forms of planning, 
but where accuracy is less important and the ability to overlay cover­ ages is essential, and where 
the range of likely demands on the system is perhaps much better defined. (1)  3. DATA AGGREGATION 
 A system designermust select an appropriate level of abstraction in converting a map to a coverage, 
and then again in converting a coverage to digital form, both as a means of reducing the sheer data 
volume. Level of data aggregation and geocoding options should be determined by the intended applications. 
Developing these inter­ relationships is crucial to the design of systems having multiple uses, but 
at the same time it is difficult to relate the designers' options to abstract data use/applicationcategories. 
Yet, systems must be designed for classes of problems, not specific applications. Data aggregation 
has two components, aggregation of phenomena to categories and spatial aggrega­tion. The level of detail 
for coverage categories and spatial units should be compatible. A large number of categories, for say 
cover or soils, generates a complex coverage, which if encoded to large spatial units, such as LUNR's 
(2) one kilometer grid imposes a high degree of spatial aggregation. Similarly a coarser coverage class­ification 
such as MLMIS (3) utilized finer spatial units (40 acre) for predominant use assignment. Consistency 
of coverage categories with spatial units is crucial to selecting a geocoding option which meets intended 
data uses/applications. It is essential to recognize that comparison of systems is made difficult if 
they have been designed for different applications. For example, a system designed principally for cartographic 
uses may more exactly replicate coverages, but may be incapable of extended applications, while a system 
less capable of replicating coverages may have more flexible geocoding structures that enable more powerful 
analytical processing, such as overlaying or generating slope maps.  4. A COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM FOR 
GEOGRAPHIC DATA A generalized communication system is comprised of elements: a data source from which 
a message is encoded, a transmitter from which a signal is emitted, a channel for communicating the signal, 
a receiver for receiving the signal and converting it back to a message to the final destination. This 
problem of sending and receiving messages through the use of the system which is constrained by channel 
capacity and the presence of perturb­ances (noise and distortion) is the general case from which this 
discussion of encoding geographic data is an application. A geographic information system also has elements 
 of a sender, receiver, message, signal and channel. The problems of channel capacity and transmission 
 cost may be considered as analogous to computer storage size and machine processing cost. Of par­ ticular 
interest in this paper is the encoding problem. In the generalized communicationsystem, information 
theory is used to measure the amount of information (in units called "bits") that is contained in the 
data being processed, and this theory aids in the evaluation of alternative encoding schemes to eliminate 
redundancy through efficient coding. Information theory is employed here to consider means of reducing 
redundancy in the storage and processing of geographic data. The adaptation of the generalized communication 
 system model to geographic data demonstrates that the terminology or organizationconcepts for information 
theory is useful in the analysis of geographic data handling problems, particularly in assessing the 
efficiency of encoding data. In applying information theory, a digital cover­ age consisting of a quantized 
arbitrarymatrix is considered a set of messages. The gray level of intensity for each cell is a "message." 
If there are m gray levels or intensity categories, the total amount of information in an n-by-n digital 
coverage (which is average amount per element times the number of elements) can be as high as n2log2m 
bits. The actual information content depends upon the probabilitieswith which the gray levels occur. 
Physical pictorial media can be used to store information at extremely high densities. However, pictures 
 encountered in practice (television images, line drawings, printed pages, etc.) have information content 
that fall appreciably short of their potential capacities, often by a factor of two or more. The difference 
between potential and actual information content is called redun­ dancy. (4) Efficient encoding of pictures 
or coverages is possible if redundancy is minimized, and there has been considerable effort made in 
 devising coding schemes to represent a picture or coverage as compactly as possible. This process 
of approximating the picture acceptably (where the standards of acceptability may be either objective 
or subjective) by another picture that has lower information con­ tent has been directed largely toward 
the goal of televisionbandwidth compression. However, the manual abstraction of coverages from pic­ 
tures and other sources provides an initial ab­ straction of the information from which further approximationis 
possible. The object is to reduce redundancy and not content. The process of creating coverages from 
images or pictures is the first step in efficient coding of pictorial information. Cells within a single 
 map segment of a coverage by definition have the same message or value. Hence, within a map seg­ ment 
a message of the next cell is a predeter­ mined value rather than a probability of that element being 
the same as the preceding element message. Thus, the source document is an abstraction of reality,which 
when encoded enables the reduction of redundancy. Consequently, encoding of coverages reduces to a 
case of coding long "runs" of repeated message. Therefore, it is then economical to encode the first 
message of each run and then the length of the run rather than encoding each message or cell in a sequence, 
and all of the detail that appears in a picture is replaced by a simpler coverage that looks like the 
original but that has a lower redundancy. The degree of "compression" that can be obtained by approximationmethods 
for generating coverages is generally greater than that obtainableby encoding techniques alone. There 
are two basic methods used to approximate pictures; these are sampling and quantization. Sampling consists 
of taking values at a finite set of points, and approximates the surface by interpolating analytically 
simple functions through these values. In quantization,one allows the function or picture to take on 
only a finite set of values or quantization levels, (replacing the actual value at each point by the 
 quantization level closest to it). In approximating a function or surface from sampling methods one 
can sample from equally spaced points or a rectangular array, though it is sometimes desirable or necessary 
to use unequally spaced points. Contouring routines such as SYMAP or trend surface analysis, using 
 polynomial interpolation, can be used to approxi­ mate the value at any point in an n-by-n matrix representing 
an n-by-n digital picture.* Figure 1 represents efficiencies in coding geo­ graphic data. Figure 1(a) 
represents an n-by-n matrix of fine cells or pixels with m gray tone levels. With no predictable pattern 
the infor­ mation content is n2log2m bits. A complex urban land use scene would have a lower level of 
 randomness or entropy and a rural land use scene would even be more orderly or less complex a pattern. 
Regular sampling to approximate the image implies a larger cell size (see Figure l(b) where n > n') 
and quantization (wherem > m'), imposes a further ordering to the image. Figure 1(c) suggests boundaries 
are drawn around contiguous sample cells of like category, thereby creating the coverage. Figure l(d) 
 consists of n'1 columns of m'1,n'2 columns of represents one type of encoding where row i m'2, and 
n'3columns of m'3. In the case of (b) the information loss can be estimated and in  (d) the coding 
efficiency can be estimated. (Run length coding, as this row record with a multiple for sequences of 
repetitious cells is called, is only one type of encoding. Polygon or line segment encodings are often 
used. The   run length coding illustrates best for the pur­pose of this discussion the potential for 
compression or efficiency of encoding.)  Figure 1 Information Content and Efficiency of Coding  The 
utility of information theory is that it forces system designers to ask important ques­ tions about 
information loss, redundancy, and coding efficiencies.  5. ERRORS IN CAPTURE AND ENCODING The capture, 
encoding and processing of coverages provides considerable "opportunity" for the intro duction of error. 
Although source document errors are not within the scope of this discus­ sion several of the more basic 
source document errors will be identified. Most attention is given to the encoding errors that occur 
in the capture of coverages. Finally, some attention is given to logical errors associated with the 
processing of data, particularlythat processing associated with editing the file to insure com­pleteness 
and error detection. Source document errors that should be removed prior to data capture, but which 
if not, should be detected for correction during or following digitizing. Source document errors usually 
con­sist of missing line segments, missing center identifiers, redundant center identifiers, or redundant 
line segments. Although it would be desirable to assume error free source documents, it is unlikely 
that error free source documents can be achieved. Conse­quently, the data capture and processing system 
must be capable of detecting and identifying the errors for subsequent remedy.  Figure 2 identifies 
various kinds of encoding errors which can occur because of or in spite of error free source documents. 
Encoding error type one is a failure to encode a line segment; type two, a failure to encode a center; 
type three, a failure to end a line segment; and type four, a redundant encoding of a center or a segment. 
 (1) Failure to encode a line segment,  (2) A center,  (3) Failure to end line segment  (4) Redundant 
encoding of center or segment  (5) Overshoot,  (6) Undershoot at junction points  (7) Digitizer error 
 (8) Inability to maintain a narrow isthmus  (9) Failure to identify contained and containing polygons 
   Figure 2. Encoding Errors  Source: Goodchild (5) (modified) Encoding errors types five and six 
consist of the overshoot and undershoot problem resulting from difficulties of digitizing line segments 
to meet at a common junction point. Encoding errors specificallywith digitizing are represented by 
encoding errors seven, eight and nine. Error type seven is a pure digitizer error caused by the movement 
to another point than in­ tended; type eight is where a narrow isthmus was not maintained and the digitizer 
created two polygons where one was intended, and error type nine consists of failure to identify contained 
and containing polygons. Source document errors and/or encoding errors that escape detection show up 
as logical errors in machine processing. These must be detected and corrected. Two types of edits are 
employed to purge files of errors. One type are those which compare points which should coincide but 
which do not because they were digitized sepa­rately; similarly, separatelyencoded lines and areas may 
be compared for reconciliation. In this way undershoots, overshoots, and slivers are removed. These 
edits can contribute to error if the threshold for closing gaps elimi­ nates an intended isthmus or short 
line segment. Graph Theory edits to purge files of missing or superfluous line segments and center identifiers 
are often employed. These consist of chaining around polygons and junctions to ensure polygons have 
a single identifier and that line segments leading to junctions close correctly. Although this discussion 
of capture and encoding  error pertains directly to digitizers, a scanner which detects the presence 
of cells that are part of a line segment and converts these line segments to polygon records must deal 
with the  same problem, as well as the additional problem of converting cells that indicate the presence 
of a line segment to polygon records. Alter­ natively, scanning the coverage to create grid data is a 
problem of filling the cells with the appropriate polygon center identifiers. Assuming a clean source 
document, scanning for the presence and absence of line segments con­sists of smoothing small scan cells 
into line segments, identifying junctions, and describing polygons and associating the correct center 
identifiers with each polygon. Such is done in the CGIS system. (6) Direct scan to grid units is an 
aggregation problem; one of combining small scan cells into grid units for storage and use. ORRMIS (7) 
performed separate scans for each category or classificationof a coverage. For coverages  consisting 
of land use or soil type, a manage­ able number of scans enabled encoding a coverage, whereas a large 
number of uniquely identified areas requires an inordinate number of scans to encode a coverage for say 
census tract identi­fiers. Scanning or automatic line following technology is more likely to encounter 
difficultywith source document errors, whereas a digitizer oper­ ator can recognize and correct many 
source docu­ ment errors. Consequently, line gaps, uneven line widths, intensity variations of patterns 
on source documents, may cause considerable problems with fully automated data capture systems. In 
addition, the logic of creating line segments and polygons from scan cells may create error situations. 
 Whether data capture is accomplished by wholly manual methods, such as overlaying a grid on a map; by 
man-machine interaction, such as digi­tizing; or completelyby machine as in scanning, the potential for 
error must be anticipated and procedures developed to insure an adequate level of quality of the encoded 
data to meet the pur­poses of the intended application. In digitizing, the degree to which interactive 
editing is employed may be a function of the level of digitizer operators. High level opera­tors may 
be capable of judgments to interactively edit data; whereas if lower level digitizer operators are employed, 
post edit of their work may be more advisable.  6. EFFECTIVENESSMEASURES AND BENCHMARK TESTS One of 
the major problems in encoding geographic data is the lack of measures by which to assess the effectiveness 
of the encoding. This section of the paper attempts to identify possible effec­tiveness measures that 
would allow comparison of data capture technology and encoding methods. On one hand, there are a set 
of effectivenessmeas­ ures that relate to the ability to replicate the source documents in map form and 
there is a second set of effectiveness measures that are more user oriented. These latter measures relate 
to the marginal utility of additional precision of data with respect to decision making, which at this 
time can only be approached by setting standards or requirements related to the degree of aggregation 
necessary for different classes of problems or applications. With respect to the former problem, that 
of replicating coverages or overlays of coverages, several effectiveness measures are suggested. If 
a coverage is assumed to consist of a large num­ber of pixels or scan cells, an effectiveness measure 
would be the proportion of pixels that are correctly classified through the polygon and grid coding. 
Similarly, an overlay of two or more coverages could also be assessed by calcu­lating the number or 
percent of pixels correctly classified. With respect to area measurement, the area estimates from polygon 
and grid coding  could be compared to the pixel count, to estimate the percent error in area measurement. 
Similarly, although beyond the scope of this investigation, effectiveness measures are generated from 
carto­graphic or map standards for cartographic applications of the coded data. In addition, there need 
to be comparative meas­ures developed with respect to quality control that encompass the error rate 
from the source document to the capture to the editing. What is needed here are per record, per cell, 
per polygon, per frame, per hour error rates for different system types by coverage type. One such measure 
 would be to regress digitized points for a line of a known function. Finally, there need to be effectiveness 
measures that relate to the appli­cations of updating, edge matching and retrieving data. Benchmark 
tests enable comparison of alternative systems. With respect to geographic data encod­ ing, one objective 
is to compare the accuracy of the final product with the original input. This kind of benchmark test 
checks the efficiency of the hardware system in the functioning of the software programs. Another objective 
is to com­ pare the accuracy of area measurement, especially after overlaying coverages. This requires 
use of standardized input in the comparison of the out­ puts utilizing statistical tests. Yet, several 
questions remain: 1. How broad or how narrow should all encoding tests be? Should it only test the 
cartographic replication of source documents? Should it include overlay analysis? Should it include other 
analysis, e.g., generating slope maps? 2. Can one general benchmark test be constructed for both digitizers 
and scanners?  3. Should there be separate benchmark tests for evaluating source documents? For encoding 
errors? For logical errors?   7. IN CONCLUSION This paper has identified a series of issues in encoding 
coverages which will require attention within the next few years. The major unresolved issue is the 
breadth of the tests to compare encoding processes. Geographic data handling for statewide land use applications 
requires addressing the issues raised in this paper. Although systems will have to be designed before 
these issues are resolved fully, the issue iden­tification process alerts system designers to potential 
problem areas. Until some of these issues are resolved, system designers should caution designers of 
geo­ graphic information systems of the potential for errors and delays and cost overruns when attempting 
to encode and replicate a large num­ ber of complex coverages. Presently a coarser statewide system 
is more appropriate, while at the same time undertaking prototype developments in smaller study areas 
to test more sophisti­ cated encoding techniques and to develop staff capabilities. REFERENCES (1) Michael

 on the Semantics of the Assignment Statement of High-level Graphical Languages Guenther Schrack The 
University of British Columbia Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Vancouver, 
B.C. V6T lW5 Canada Abstract Based on the concept of treating gra­phical data as a data type in its 
 own right with associated language parts and constructs such as graphical constants, graphical variables 
and graphical express­ions, the semantics of the assignment statement of a high-level graphical pro­gramming 
language are investigated in some detail. It is assumed that the graphical data are defined by the 
areal external repre­sentation model. In addition, the seman­tics of binary operators, the superposi­tion 
and the deletion operators, are con­ sidered. 1. Introduction Much effort has gone into the design 
and implementation of graphical program­ming languages and graphical language extensions [1,3,4,5,6,7,8]. 
From initial attempts with ad hoc solutions, sophisti­cated and powerful high-level programming languages 
have been developed. However, a unified treatment of the language objects of concern, viz. graphical 
data, has not emerged. A study of the literature on pro­gramming languages leads to the conclusion that 
graphical data should in fact be treated formally as a data type. An inves­tigation has shown the concept 
to be feasible [5]. This paper is a report on an inquiry into the semantics of the graphical assignment 
statement and of two graphical binary operators, the superposition and the deletion operator. 2. General 
Concepts Pictorial (or two-dimensional) data are considered to constitute a single data class. Members 
of that class are data types such as RASTER, COLOUR, GRAPHICAL etc. The data type GRAPHICAL, the only 
data type to be discussed in this paper, represents line drawings. A unit of gra­phical information which 
is considered logically as a single unit is called a Permission to make digital or hard copies of part

graphical object. Graphical data are re­ presentatives of graphical information; the value of a graphical 
datum is a gra­ phical object. The set of all graphical objects representable internally in a ma­ chine 
is called the domain of the data type GRAPHICAL. When dealing with graphical data, an important aspect 
is the model employed for the external representation of a graphical object. The model governs the kind, 
beha­viour and number of the graphical oper­ators required to process graphical data. For the data type 
GRAPHICAL, two basically different models can be distinguished. One, called the lineal external represen­tation 
model, is based on the vector (line segment). Each graphical object has a head and a tail [4]. The other, 
called the areal external representation model, is based on the plane (surface patch). Each graphical 
object is considered as a finite surface of sufficient but undetermined size and shape. One particular 
point on the surface is called the reference point of the graphical object and is required in connection 
with graphical operators. Only graphical data employing the areal exter­nal representationwill be considered 
in the sequel. In graphical data processing, graphi­cal data appear in different language con­texts. 
Any language construct or datum which possesses as value a graphical ob­ject is called a data form. Graphical 
con­stants, graphical primitives (the atomic graphical constants from which data forms with more complex 
graphical objects are built from), graphical variables (subs­cripted or not), graphical input and output 
data, and graphical expressions are examples of graphical data forms. Associated with each graphical 
object are data named attributes. In particular, the coordinates of the reference point, the scale factors 
and the angle of rota­tion with respect to the reference point are called attributes. A graphical object 
can be transformed (translated,changed in scale, rotated, etc.) by unary graphical operators called modification 
operators. They simply change the attributes of the graphical object in question. These oper­ators are 
considered unary because they operate on a single graphical object, even though they require numerical 
arguments, thus have several arguments. For example, consider the graphical assignment state­ment  
This statement defines the graphical var­iable P with the aid of a graphical var­iable Q which is being 
modified by the three modification operators AT, SCALE and ANGLE. The modification operators have as 
 arguments variable Q and a single or a pair of arithmetic expressions. Although the syntax used here 
is that of LIG [5], no attempt is made to plead in favour or against this notation. A set of modifica­tion 
operators and their numerical argu­ments is called a modification. Modifica­tions are defined by default 
and are therefore optional. Modification operators are considered to be on the same level of operator 
hierarchy; if several appear in a modification, they are assumed to be exe­cuted from left to right. 
Their hierarchial level is below that of arith­metic operators in order to force an evaluation of the 
arithmetic arguments first. The exact semantics of the modifi­ cation operators are not of interest here; 
for more details, see [5]. The meta-notation which will be emp­ loyed below for assignments and expressions 
is the following. A graphical constant, graphical primitive or graphical variable is denoted by one 
of the capital letters P, Q, R, and S. The symbols <a>, <b>,... are used to denote a modification 
which need not necessarily be distinct. 3. Graphical Expressions, Graphical Assignment Statements, the 
Superposition Operator If a graphical variable, say P, has not been defined previously in a program 
and appears in an assignment statement of the form P := Q <a>; the right-hand side will be called a 
simple graphical expression, the statement itself a simple graphical assignment statement and the operator 
denoted by the symbol ":=" the assignment operator. (Refer to the Appendix for a syntax of the graphical 
assignment statement.) Evidently, in order to allow the de­finition of graphical objects based on previously 
defined graphical objects, operators in addition to modification operators are required. Two will be 
consi­dered in detail, the superposition and the deletion operators, jointly to be referred to as the 
manipulation operators. Both are treated as binary infix operators, and their symbols will be the plus 
("+") and the minus ("-") sign respectively. Howe­ver, the syntax and symbolism of these operators are 
not of primary importance in this discussion. The superposition operator combines two modified or unmodified 
graphical ob­jects by superimposing them in such a way that their reference points conincide. Each of 
the graphical objects of the operands becomes a part of the new graphi­cal object without opaquing or 
oblitera­ting any part of the other. The superposi­tion operator is commutative, i.e., the values of 
the graphical variables P and S in the statements  are identical. Additionally, superposition is associative, 
i.e., the graphical super­ positions in the statement P := 0 <a> + R <b> + S <c>; may be grouped from 
the left or from the right. In order to insure that superposi­ tion is invoked only after all modifica­ 
tions have been carried out, the superpo­ sition operator must be lower in the oper­ ator hierarchy than 
the modification oper­ ators. Two or more simple graphical express­ ions which are concatenated by manipula­ 
tion operators will be called a complex graphical expression, and an assignment statement with a complex 
graphical ex­ pression as its right-hand side, a complex graphical assignment statement. 4. Assignment, 
Reassignment, and Redefinition Statements Two assumptions will be made regar­ding graphical assignment 
statements: (a) Only one language construct can define the value of a graphical variable; it is the 
graphical assignment statement. (b) A deferred assignment is not allowable, i.e., each graphical constant 
or graphical variable appearing in a gra­ phical expression must have been assigned a value by a statement 
executed previous­ly. For the implementationof a program­ming language, a distinction needs to be made 
whether a given variable name, ap­pearing on the left-hand side of an assignment statement, appears 
in the pro­gram for the first time or whether it had appeared in some language construct pre­viously. 
Therefore, to take into account the "past" of a graphical variable, a dis­tinction is made between an 
assignment, a reassignment and a redefinition statement. By an assignment statement the value of a 
 hitherto undefined graphical variable is defined. By a reassignment statement a graphical object is 
assigned to a graphi­ cal variable which is unrelated to the value which had been defined previously 
on another occasion. For example, consider the two statements (assumed to appear in the same program): 
 P := Q <a>; ... (1)  The first is an assignment statement pro­vided the variable name P appears in 
the program for the first time; the second is a reassignment statement since the right­hand side of the 
two statements are for­mally unrelated to each other. The effect of the reassignment statement should 
be natural, i.e., one that a programmer would expect according to the "Law of Least Surprise". Thus, 
in above example, the previous value Q <a> of P is lost and P is assigned the new value S <c>. These 
seman­ tics must hold for more complicated assignment statements, as for example in  A reassignment 
statement, then, discards the present value of a graphical variable and assigns it a new one. So far, 
not all possibilities of de­finition have been exhausted: the defini­tion of a graphical object in terms 
of itself is an admissable and often de­sirable situation. Such an assignment statement is called a redefinition 
state­ ment. As an example, consider the state­ments  where statement (6) is a redefinition statement. 
The modification <b> in state­ment (6) may, of course, be missing. The semantics of this type of state­ 
ment requires further discussion. First, again according to the "Law of Least Surprise", the redefinition 
statement should be equivalent to statement (6), due to the commutativityof the superposition operator. 
Second, a substitution of state­ment (5) into (6) shows that (6) is equi­valent, in effect, to the statement 
 where the sequence of execution of the mo­difications is assumed to be, as men­tioned, from left to 
right. Seen in this light, a redefinition is in effect just a reassignment with the exception that a 
repeated modification takes place. For a further example, consider  The redefinition statement may be 
mistaken as a recursion statement, which is, however, not the intention here. At least one graphical 
language (GROAN [8]) allows the recursive definition of a gra­ phical object. The effect of such a state­ment 
is equivalent to what can be accomp­lished by the following sequence of state­ments involving a redefinition 
statement within a loop: where the numerical arguments of the modi­ fication operators in <b> depend 
on the iteration counter K in some fashion. Whether a recursion statement is of value for a graphical 
language depends entirely on the application intended for programs written in that language. GROAN 
 is an interactive or dialogue language, and its recursion ability might well be desirable, e.g. in aiding 
an artist for producing graphical art work. The graphical data which the suppor­ ting subprogram system 
of an implemented graphical programming language creates during the course of execution of an app­lication 
program is called the data base. It consists in a substantial part of data blocks storing interrelated 
data of dif­ferent data types as well as pointers connecting the data blocks. To allow wri­ting efficient 
algorithms for setting and resetting the pointers, and for a garbage collection scheme to be effective, 
a fur­ther distinction must be made among the reassignment and redefinition statements. Thus, statement 
(4) is called a reassign­ment statement of type complex-simple, since the assignment statement (3) de­fining 
P is complex and (4) itself is simple. The other types are, of course, simple-simple, simple-complex 
and complex­complex. Statement (8), then, is a rede­finition statement of type complex-comp­ lex. 5. 
The Deletion Operator In contrast to the syntax and seman­tics of the superposition operator, which 
are quite straight-forward and where the "addition" of two graphical objects to form a new one is suggested 
by the symbol "+", both syntax and semantics of the de­letion operator are severely restricted. The 
difficulties arise from the fact that the deletion operator is an operator which cannot have any two 
objects from the domain of its data type as its operands, as is the case for the superposition oper­ator 
and, e.g., for numerical subtraction. A graphical object named "door" cannot be deleted from the graphical 
object "house" unless the latter had been defined to inc­lude, by superposition, the former. Futhermore, 
the definition of the graphi­cal object "house" from that named "door" is an entirely different matter: 
obvious­ly, the deletion operator is not commutative. Purpose and semantics of the deletion operator 
must be closely tied to the superposition operator; it is, in fact, an operator the sole purpose of which 
is to reverse a previously executed operation of the superpositionoperator. Thus assuming that the right 
operand  of the deletion operator is the graphical object to be deleted from the value of the left operand, 
the graphical assignment statement  cannot be correct semantically since its left operand is a modified 
operand. (Inverse modifications are assumed to be unavailable or undefined: given modifica­tions <a> 
and <b>, if <a><b> = <default modification>, then <b> is called the in­verse modification of <a> and 
vice versa.) These considerations point out that quite severe restrictions need to be imposed on the 
use of the deletion operator. Consider the example  Statement (10) employs the deletion oper­ator legally 
since it reverses the action of the superposition operator in statement (9). By direct substitution, 
(10) becomes Note that in statement (10), the left operand of the deletion operator is an unmodified 
graphical variable and that the right operand is a graphical variable or constant modified by a modification 
iden­ tical to that in statement (9). Generally, neither graphical constants, modified or not, nor 
modified graphical variables may be used as a left operand of the deletion operator. In the example 
above, statement (9) could have been replaced by P := R <b> + Q <a>; since the superpositionoperator 
is commu­tative, and statement (10) would still be legal. No restriction needs to be introduced for 
the case where the left operand of the deletion operator and the variable on the left-hand side of 
the assignment statement are identical: On the contrary, for interactive graphical programming such 
a statement is a particu­larly important one. This construction will appear in a program which allows 
the user to reverse an incorrect or unsatisfa­ctory superposition. The special case P := P -P; or its 
equivalent should reassign P to the graphical primitive BLANK. Attempts to use the deletion operator 
 illegally should result in a compiler error if the illegal use can be detected at the syntax level, 
else in a run-time error. Examples would be the appearance of a graphical constant on the left of the 
deletion operator, and an attempt to delete a graphical object from a graphical variable which is not 
part of that graphi­ cal variable. Multiple appearances of the deletion operator in a single graphical 
expression can be admissable, provided it is legal semantically, i.e., the graphical objects to be deleted 
must all be part of the value of the left-most operand. As the de­letion operator is not associative, 
execu­tion proceeds from left to right. Thus, the complex graphical expression  When using parentheses, 
care must be taken to insure that all graphical ex­ pressions involving the deletion operator are still 
legal. The expression P -(Q -R <b>) is legal as is but may not have a modifi­ cation following the 
graphical variable Q. As to the hierarchy of this operator, the "Law of Least Surprise" suggests that 
the deletion operator should be executed first if it appears in an expression where both manipulation 
operators occur. This will insure that only the graphical var­iable immediately to the left of the dele­tion 
symbol is taken as its operand. 6. Assignment by Name and Assignment by Value Flon [2] distinguishes 
among two kinds of data, depending on their nature and mode of storage. A scalar datum is a datum which 
is referred to and stored as a single unit; a complex datum is normally accessed as a single unit but 
stored in more than one storage cell. For complex data, occasions may arise where it is de­sirable to 
access any one of its parts, and language constructs must exist to allow this. Single and double precision 
 floating point numbers are examples for scalar data; data of type COMPLEX and CHARACTER STRING are 
complex data, the former having two parts (a real and an imaginary part), the latter having many parts 
(substringsof one or more charac­ters in a given position of the string). Depending on the complexity 
of the data base, i.e. on the data structure re­quired to store a complex datum, an assignment statement 
can be implemented in two different ways, called assignment by name or assignment by value. An assignment 
by value executes the operations occurring on the right-hand side of the assignment statement, and copies 
the result into the location assigned to the variable of its left-hand side. An assignment by name does 
not necessarily carry out the required operations but manipulates the data base in such a manner that 
the desired complex datum can be referred to whenever re­quired. If for a given programming language, 
the assignment statement is implemented as an assignment by name, effects may arise which may not be 
desirable. Two such ef­ fects will be discussed specifically in the context of a graphical language: 
de­ferred assignment and the effect on the deletion operator. A graphical datum is a complex datum 
since quite an elaborate and extensive data structure is required in order to store a graphical object 
and since it may become desirable, on occasion, to inspect or change one of the attributes of a gra­ 
phical object. Since graphical data are complex data, it will be more efficient both in respect to 
storage as well as to execution time to implement a graphical assignment statement as an assignment 
by name. Consider an assignment statement such as (1) or (3). Even if the graphical var­iable Q had 
not been assigned a value pre­vious to the execution of the statement, an assignment by name of Q to 
P can still be made because no actual operations beyond setting pointers and storing attri­ butes 
are carried out at this point. Such an assignment is known as a deferred assi­ gnment of Q. Of course, 
before P is being displayed, it will be necessary to assign a graphical object to the variable 0. Depending 
on the expected sophistica­tion of the programmer using the graphical language, it may be desirable not 
to allow such assignments. If deferred assignments are to be illegal, the compiler or prepro­ cessor 
would still need to accomodate programs where the first physical ap­ pearance of a graphical variable 
is on the right-hand side of an assignment state­ment, even though logically the sequence is in correct 
order:  Similar examples can be given invol­ving the deletion operator. Such examples show that it might 
be desirable to include in a graphical language an assignment-by­ value statement which should be used 
 only if necessary. In fact, the language TUNA [1] does have the two assignment state­ments, they are 
distinguished by two dif­ferent assignment operators. 7. Conclusion This paper discusses various aspects 
of the semantics of the graphical assign­ ment statement of a higher-level graphical programming language, 
for which the gra­phical data are based on the areal exter­ nal representationmodel. In particular, 
the semantics of the manipulation oper­ators are investigated. Although a pro­grammer using such a language 
need not be aware of most details and distinctions pointed out, these considerations become important 
for the implementation of the language, i.e. for the construction of a compiler or preprocessor and 
the suppor­ting software system. Some of the characteristicsof these assignments and operators have 
been imple­ mented and tested for the Language for Interactive Graphics (LIG), a graphics extension of 
Fortran [5]. That language has been used and evaluated by a number of programmers and found to be sound, 
al­ though more experience and a refinement of the language and of the system is de­sirable. It may 
be noted finally that most problems considered above are not unique for the data type GRAPHICAL but 
arise for any data type which is implemented as com­plex data, i.e. with a data base containing pointers 
within its structure. 8. References [1] Toby S. Berk, "TUNA: A high level graphical programming language",

 ENHANCED GRAPHICS PERFORMANCEWITH USER CONTROLLED SEGMENT FILES W. D. Little* and R. Williams IBM 
Research Laboratory San Jose, California 95193 This paper describes a simple idea for extending the 
use of display segment files in computer display systems. The extension is to provide manual control 
of segment files in a display terminal as well as program control from a host computer. The use of display 
segments local to the display makes it possible to speed up the rate at which pictures are displayed 
when the communicationsline to the host computer is slow or when the host machine is time-shared and 
heavily loaded. The manual control of segments are terminal functions that work for any program including 
old programs that knew nothing about display segments. Keywords: Computer Graphics, Interactive Systems, 
Data Structures, Display Files CR Categories: 4.34, 4.4, 8.2  Fig. 1 The Graphics System Architecture 
 1. INTRODUCTION Many graphics systems use a host computer and a second small computer with data paths 
similar to that shown in Fig. 1. Our architectural philosophy has been to develop a terminal with memory 
rather than a satellite computer system. No application code and no application data reside in the terminal 
 Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work or personal or classroom use is 
granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage 
and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, to republish, 
to post on servers, or to redistribute to lists, requires prior 179 specific permission and/or a fee. 
Siggraph 76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and our application runs equally well on a storage-tube 
terminal as on the terminal shown in Fig. 1. In our system, the host machine supports the application 
data base and executes the  application program whereas the terminal interacts with the user, services 
the communications line and controls the display hardware. With many such systems, the bandwidth of 
the communicationsline  between the host and terminal and the service from the host limit the rate at 
which pictures can be displayed. This paper discusses the implementation and use of manually controlled 
segment files to speed up the rate at which pictures can be displayed and to reduce the computation required 
at the host. Manually created segments do not exist as segments in the host; the application code need 
have no notion of segments, and segments created manually are not modified or returned to the host. However, 
segments can also be created by host application programs. Segments created either way are compatible. 
 2. SEGMENT FILES We define a segment as a sequence of commands, each of which maps into a command 
to the display system (see Fig. 1). Segment files can be created at the terminal, and stored on a disc, 
so that they can be redisplayed in the future. The management of segment files can be directed from 
 the applications program by appropriate calls to the display package, or alternately, the files can 
be managed by user inputs at the terminal. We refer to the former segment file management as "programmed 
controlled" and the latter form as "user controlled." Program controlled segment files have been used 
widely with refresh displays, where in essence the segment files are an extension of the display files 
[1]. For non-refresh displays, display files are not required and segment files are rarely used, so 
that each picture displayed must be generated by the applications program. One reason that segment 
files are rarely used with non-refresh systems to reduce host processing and to decrease communicationsdelays 
is because application programmers cannot predict which segments the user may want filed. With the user 
controlled segment files that we have implemented, the user has complete control of segment storage 
at run time and the applications programmer need not be concerned with segments at all. The user stores 
 segments as he (she) sees fit during a session at the display in order to improve response and reduce 
 host processing. Even existing application programs that were written without knowledge of segment 
files can benefit from user controlled segment files, because no extra programming is required in an 
application program to use segments manually. Because the reviewers of our paper did not fully appreciate 
the general discussion, it is worthwhile to illustrate the manual control of segments with specific example 
scenarios. Example one: A local government employee is using a graphics terminal to view data on a map 
in order to investigate a proposed change in zoning in the town. He accesses data in a data base and 
displays it on a map in various ways [2]. The map is a section of a large map and this section is used 
repeatedly with different data displayed on it. The map can be shaded according to income distribution 
or population distribution, or traffic flow, or land slope, or water drainage, etc. The user would like 
to make a display segment of his map and store it locally so that it can be redisplayed more quickly 
for each display of data on the map. This is important when the communication line to the host is slow 
or the time-shared host response is slow. Example performance calculations are shown below. Example 
two: An investment counselor is querying a very large data base about the performance of stocks in 
order to decide how to invest pension funds. Searching and retrieval of data involves lengthy calculations 
and finally graphs and charts are displayed. Each graph (or several overlayed graphs) can be manually 
"saved" at the terminal so that redisplaying a graph for comparisonwith another graph will be much 
faster and cheaper than reaccessing and extracting the data from the database. In the first example, 
the segment data was used to redisplay a "background" to the main display and saved communicationtime. 
In the second case, the segments were used as a "soft" copy and saved computation and communication time. 
In both cases it was not possible to predict ahead of time how to organize the data into segments, only 
the user knew while executing programs. No extra code had to be written in either case once the function 
had been provided in the terminal. The terminal function works for any application and basically provides 
"soft" copy capability with the ability to add to the copy or mix copies or compose nested copies. The 
application program can also invoke all the functions as well and segments created by a host program 
in the terminal are completely compatible with manually created segments.  3. PERFORMANCE The improvement 
in response time for local segments is dependent upon the amount of data in a segment, the communication 
line bandwidth, the host response time, the data extraction or computation time, etc., and is impossible 
to predict in general, but easily calculated in specific cases. For example consider a map of 2 000 
vectors, a fairly simple map, for which each vector is two points x,y and each coordinate value is 
16 bits. The map is defined by 2 000x2x2x16 bits = 128 000 bits. If the vectors are connected, this 
reduces to about 64 000 bits to be transmitted to the terminal. Consider a disc storage in the terminal 
with an access time of 100 msec average and 5 Mbit read rate. Then the data can be accessed and read 
 in 100 + 64 000/5 000) msec = 113 msec. If the host time sharing system response time is th and the 
 computation time is tc, then the following results:  180 consider the delay to update a refresh memory 
or to draw 2 000 vectors, which is different for different types of displays and can range from about 
100 msec to a few seconds. Whenever a lengthy calculation tc or a poor response time th is encountered, 
the performance gain is also considerable.  In our implementationthere are several independent files, 
each containing up to 150 segments. A brief description of the segment management within a file and the 
management of files is given next. 4. SEGMENT MANAGEMENT Segment management, whether program or user 
controlled, is performed by four terminal functions:  These functions can be invoked in three ways: 
 1. by control words inserted into the  host/satellitecommand stream by calls to display package subroutines 
in the case of programmed controlledsegments.  2. by control words generated by a user  activating 
functions with an input device such as a keyboard in the case of user controlled segments. 3. by control 
words read from a previously stored segment that is being displayed.  The control words are generated 
automaticallywhen the terminal functions are initiated. The OPEN-SEG function sets segment number, SEG-NO, 
to the OPEN and ACTIVE state and places SEG-NO in the directory of a linked-list segment file (if it 
is not already in the directory). While the segment is OPEN all segment data and control words are inserted 
in the file as they are received. The VIS parameter sets the VISIBILITY status of the terminal (if visible, 
the incoming segment is sent to be displayed and is stored in the file but if invisible, the segment 
is stored but not displayed). By this means, it is possible to build a file of many segments, perhaps 
rather slowly if transmission line or host limited, and display the stored segments rapidly at a later 
time as required. The CLOSE-SEG function terminates the ACTIVE and OPEN states of a segment. The DISPLAY-SEG 
(SEG-NO) function puts SEG-NO in the ACTIVE state and displays the specified segment provided the VISIBILITY 
status is set ot visible. DELETE-SEG removes the specified segment from the directory file. Segment 
nesting is supported by these four functions also. Each use of OPEN-SEG or DISPLAY-SEG stacks the ACTIVE, 
OPEN, and VISIBILITY status while CLOSE-SEG unstacks the status variables. An example application program 
containing host application code to generate segments is shown in Fig. 2.  Fig. 2 Application Program 
Defining Nested Segments Three segments would be created. Segment 1 would contain graphic display commands 
to display streets, an OPEN command to invoke segment 2, and a CLOSE command. Segment 2 would contain 
highway graphic commands, an OPEN command to invoke segment 3, and a CLOSE command. Segment 3 would contain 
a map outline and a CLOSE command. These files would be created at the terminal but not displayed while 
being created because of the 0 visibility parameter in the OPEN calls. Once created the segment can 
be displayed by program or user  initiated control words. Display of segment 3 would draw only the 
map outline, display of 2 would draw highways and the outline, while display of 1 would give the streets, 
the highways, and the outline. Note that without any application code the same effect at the screen 
can be created by manually generating each segment. However, the segments would then be "unknown" to 
the application program but available as "soft-copy." Both methods have their uses and power.  5. 
FILE MANAGEMENT In order to allow several users to have their own independent files, there are three 
file commands. These are:  A user may first initialize a file (erase all previously stored segments), 
and then create and store segments using the segment commands and the PUT-WORD routine. At the end 
of a session he can save a file, i.e., "CLOSE" it. To actually fetch data from or write data into segments, 
the following two routines, which are self-explanatory, are needed: GET-WORD (WORD,ENDFLAG) PUT-WORD 
(WORD)  6. COMMENTS The picture segment file system has been implemented at the IBM, San Jose, ResearchLab 
on a System/7 computer which drives a color refresh display. It has been used to speed up the redisplay 
of shaded maps in the GADS system [2] and for storage and manipulation of segments produced by ROBART, 
an interactive drawing system used for producing color slides. It will also be used with the Picture 
Building System which is being developed [3,4].  181 7. CONCLUSION Manual control, as well as program 
control, of picture segments at a display terminal is a most useful function. This function can be 
used by programs that have picture segment handling in the application code. The local storage and 
 redisplay of picture segments can reduce communications delays and thereby speed-up the execution 
of application programs. This is particularly important on slow-speed telecommunicationlines with a 
speed of 110 bits/sec but less so on lines at 9 600 bits/sec. In addition, there is also the advantage 
of reducing the load on the host machine and an effective speed-up of execution when the host machine 
is very heavily loaded. REFERENCES [1] W. M. Newman and R. F. Sproull, Principles of Interactive Computer

 KEYWORDS: Relational Data Base, Computer Graphics, Programming INTRODUCTION This paper describes the 
design and implementation of a general purpose 'picturebuilding system'. The main purpose of the system 
is to simplify the task of creating and using application programs. The use of a graphics terminal can 
greatly simplify both application programming and the end use of a program. However a central problem 
in programming is that of structuring the data, and this problem is particularly acute for graphical 
applications. Frequently graphics software packages provide for little or no data structuring. In addition 
to a graphics software package the picture building system provides high-level application building tools 
and a relational data base[1] as integral parts. Data is stored in relations which can be nested so that 
an arbitrary hierarchical data structure can be formed. If a system using graphics has some data base 
support, generally only the nongraphical data is stored in the data base. Even in cases where graphical 
data is stored in the data base it is not directly usable for input and output to a graphics terminal. 
For, example, if an inventory of parts is kept in a data base, a picture of each part is not kept in 
the data base, althougha separate microfilm library may contain such pictures. Our data base does allow 
graphical and nongraphical data to be stored together. This capability is made possibleby allowingdata 
to have graphical 'meaning'; thus graphical data can be said to be self-describing. Having unified data 
base support for graphical as well as nongraphical data can simplify programming. Also, because the 
graphical data is self-describing, programs and data can be made essentially independent. Thus one program 
may work for many different sets of data and one data base may be used by many programs. The picture 
building system provides high level Interactive Systems, Data Structures, Application commands for 
easy use of the data base and of graphics terminals. Commands are included to facilitate graphical input 
to the data base and graphical output from the data base. BACKGROUND The Picture Building System consists 
of a number of component parts as shown in the system diagram(fig. 1)[2][3][4]. The data base is a 
relational data base called XRM[5]. A relational data base is a data base that allows a user to view 
his data as a collection of relations. A relation is a table or flat file in which the columns may 
have certain attributes[l]. A row or record of a relation shall be referred to as a tuple and a column 
or field of a relation shall be referred to as a domain. Fig. 2 shows a sample relation with the domain 
values listed under the domain names. The symbolic interface to the relational data base is GXRAM[6], 
which allows relations and domains to be referenced by mnemonic name. A comprehensive set of commands 
for all the usual data base operations is provided. GXRAM supports relations as definded by Codd[l]. 
In addition, it supports relationswith the following features: 1) ordered tuples, and 2) duplicate 
tuples (no key[l]). We have found both of these features to be very useful when storing graphical data 
in relations[2]. The interpreter traces through any hierarchy of relations, converting the graphical 
data to calls to a low level display package (DISPLIB[see acknowledgements]). Thus the interpreter draws 
pictures from data stored in relations. DISPLIB is a graphics subroutine package with routines such as 
move the beam, draw a line, draw characters, etc. DISPLIB works for a variety of display terminals and 
thus allows device independence for routines which call it. This paper will not discuss DISPLIB in detail. 
Correlation refers to the process of  Fig. 1 -System Diagram for the Picture Building System  identifying 
an item displayed on a graphics terminal. The correlationhandler allows a user to identify and manipulate 
displayed items. GRAPHICAL MEANING In order for data to be used by a program it must have a syntax 
or structure as it is usually called, and some semantic content. Clearly one must know how the data 
is stored and accessed(syntax), and how it is to be used(semantics) before it can be processed. Traditionallydata 
bases provide syntax support for data but do not provide semantic support. Consequently semantic information 
must be stored in the program accessing the data base, and thus the programs and data are no longer 
 independent. Associated with the data in the data base there is certain semantic information. Also, 
 unless the data base supports only one fixed structure, there is certain syntactic information describing 
the data structure and access paths. If semantic information and a description of the syntax is stored 
along with data in a data base, then that data is said to be self-describing. All the graphical data 
in our data base is self-describing. Together with each relation a description of the structure of the 
relations and each of the domains is stored. The description of each domain contains certain semantic 
information which is called the graphical meaning of the domain. Storing a graphical meaning for each 
domain in a relation allows pictures to be drawn directly from data in the data base and independently 
of the program which created that graphical data. Table 1 has a list of the allowable graphical meanings. 
The list is intended to be comprehensive,but other graphical meanings could be added with no effect 
on previous application programs. The graphical meanings and the interpreter have been designed to handle 
three dimensional data, but so far only two dimensional capabilities have been implemented. Each domain 
in a relation can have a graphical meaning associated with it. Thus a tuple in a relation may have different 
graphical meanings associated with each field in that tuple. Fig. 3 shows an example of a relation that 
draws some lines and second a relation with calls to the first relation. The domain names used in that 
figure are meant to be indicative of the graphical meanings. An application using the picture building 
system consists of two parts: 1) an application program, and 2) a set of applicationrelations. A relations 
editor is provided to interactively create, edit, and display relations. Thus an applicationwhich only 
displays pictures or makes queries of the data base requires no application program. For example, if 
the data base contains data for an inventory of parts, then the parts could be drawn and the inventory 
data could be examined interactively from the relations editor. The picture building system works on 
a variety of graphic and nongraphic terminals. In particular it works on IBM 2250 refresh terminals, 
Tektronic storage tube terminals, and RAINBOW, a color raster T.V. system[3].  Fig. 3 -Example Relations 
for Drawing Lines A domain can have a graphical meaning RELATION, thus a tuple can contain a 'call' 
to another relation. The relation called can be another standard tabular relation in the data base 
or it may be a procedural relation that is, a normal program. A relation may be called with parameters. 
These parameters can be implicit ones such as color, shift, rotation, etc. or they may be explicit 
parameters(P1,P2,...,P10). Rotation, scaling, and shifting specified in a tuple apply to that tuple 
and to any relations called by that tuple. If there are several levels of relations called, then the 
transformationsare compounded and stacked appropriately by the interpreter when it is displaying the 
relation. A domain with a graphical meaning of CORRELATION (light pen sensitivity) may take on three 
values: 1) make this tuple and all relations called by it correlatable, 2) make this tuple and all relations 
called by it not correlatable, 3) do not change correlatablility; that is, disregard this domain. A tuple 
may specify a color, in which case that color applies to that tuple and all relations called by that 
tuple. A null value for color will cause the domain to be ignored. A domain with graphical meaning of 
XYZOPERATION specifies an operation on the domains which specify X, Y, Z position, TEXTSTRING, and RASTERSTRING. 
A raster string is a bit string which specifies whether consecutive points on a display line should be 
on or off. The XYZOPERATION can indicate that the X, Y, Z point(s) are the end-points of a line, the 
corner points of a rectangle, the starting point of a text string, etc. Table 2 lists the possible XYZOPERATIONS. 
Some of the XYZOPERATIONS require two points whereas others require only one point. The window and viewport 
specify a mapping from the user data space to a logical screen space. All or part of the data space may 
be mapped into all or part of the display screen. WINDOW AND VIEWPORT Before the interpreter can display 
a relation a mapping from the data space to the logical screen space must exist. If the default mapping 
is acceptable then no user action is necessary. To set a mapping different from the default mapping a 
program must be called with a relation name and tuple number as input. The program will extract information 
from the specified tuple to set the desired mapping. Positional data in a relation refers to positions 
in some implicit coordinate space. This coordinate space shall be referred to as the data space. A rectangular 
area in the data space is called a window. A display screen is considered to have its lower lefthand 
and upper righthand corners at (0,0) and (1,1) (standard x, y axes) in the logical screen space. Thus 
mapping a window to the rectangle (0,0) to (1,1) in the logical screen space would map the window onto 
the full screen. A rectangular area in the logical screen space (or just display space for short) is 
called a viewport. A mapping from the data space to the display space is specified by choosing a window 
and a viewport. This use of window and viewport is similar to Newman and Sproul[7]. A relation which 
contains window and viewport information shall be refered to as a view relation.  Table 1 -GRAPHICAL 
MEANINGS  INTERPRETER The interpreter is the major source of graphical output for the picture building 
system. Unlike other interpreters for graphical data[8][9], this interpreter does not work on a fixed 
data structure. The interpreter determines the syntax(structure) and semantics(graphicalmeaning) of 
the data from syntactic and semantic information stored in the data base. The interpreter can be invoked 
 to display a relation on a graphics terminal. Since any tuple in a relation may have one or many calls 
to other relations, the relation displayed may be an arbitrary network of relations. The interpreter 
traces through the data in the relation producing calls to DISPLIB to draw a picture on the current display 
device. As the interpreter traces through a relation it also creates a correlation table (through calls 
to DISPLIB). Correlation will be explained in detail in the next section. The interpreter may display 
 an entire relation or just a single tuple. Fig. 4 is a flow chart of the interpreter. The following 
is a description of the action performed by the interpreter when displaying a relation. The action when 
displaying a single tuple is similar. The interpreter gets a description of the domains of the relation 
 and fetches the first tuple. If any transformations(rotation, scaling, shifting) or parameters are 
specified they are recorded. If an XYZOPERATION is specifed, then calls to DISPLIB are made to perform 
the proper operation with the proper transform, parameters, and correlation vector(see next section). 
 Then the tuple is checked for calls to other relations. If a procedural relation is called then that 
procedure is executed and control returned to the interpreter. If there are calls to tabular relations 
then certain variables are stacked and the interpreter is called recursively. When control returns to 
the first tuple, the transformationand parameters are restored and the next tuple is fetched. The rest 
of the tuples in the original relation are processed in a similar fashion CORRELATION Correlation is 
the identificationof an item in the data base by pointing at its representation on a display terminal. 
The correlation process involves two steps: 1) identifying the item on the display screen and 2) linking 
the displayed item to the data base. The correlation mechanism also returns the x,y coordinates of the 
position pointed to, in user coordinates; that is, data space coordinates. If a vector refresh terminal 
like an IBM 2250 is used, then a displayed item can be identified directly from the display file[7]. 
For a raster T.V. terminal or a storage tube terminal, with no hardware display file, identifying a 
displayed item must be handled differently. As the interpreter displays relations entries are created 
in a correlation table. The correlation table contains one entry for each line, area, or text string 
displayed which is correlatable (light pen detectable). An entry in the correlation table consists of 
positional information specifying the extent of the item, and a vector identifying the item in the data 
base. A vector is needed due to the hierarchical structure of the data. Invoking  Fig. 4 -Flow Chart 
of the Interpreter the correlation mechanism causes the following actions to take place: 1) an x,y 
position is read in from a light pen or a cursor, 2) the correlation table is searched for an item 
that intersects or nearly intersects the returned x,y position, 3) the vector of identifying information 
for the 'hit' item is returned, and 4) the x,y coordinates are converted to data space coordinates and 
returned. The basic item in the data base that can be correlated is a tuple. A tuple may represent, 
 among other things, a line, a text string, or a call to another relation. A displayed relation may be 
represented by a tree as in fig. 5b. The internal nodes represent relations, the branches represent 
tuples, and the leaves represent displayed items. The purpose of correlation (aside from returning 
a postion) is to choose, from graphical input, a node in the tree; that is, a tuple in the data base. 
Consider the relation SHAPE (fig.3) drawn as a tree in fig. 5. Suppose one wished to choose the first 
line in relation TRIANGLE (as called from the first tuple of SHAPE. The term pointer shall be used 
 to mean a unique identifier for a tuple. Returning a single pointer  to the first tuple in TRIANGLE 
is not sufficient since TRIANGLE is called twice from SHAPE. In general a vector of pointers (called 
a correlation vector) for an entire path down the tree is necessary to uniquely determine how a tuple 
fits into the structure of the data base. The correlated item can be anyone of the tuples referenced 
by the returned correlation vector. The correlation handler is a collection of commands that allow correlation 
and manipulation of the correlated item. The correlated item may be deleted or redisplayed (possibly 
in a different color). Thus it is simple to provide visual feedback for identifying displayed items. 
Also, any domain value in the correlated tuple can be read or changed. This ability allows many high 
level graphic functions to be easily implemented. For example, the graphic operation 'move a displayed 
object' is carried out by 1) correlating to identify the object being moved, 2) correlating to read in 
an x,y position, 3) recomputing the domain values which specify position (graphical meaning SHIFTX, SHIFTY, 
SHIFTZ) in the tuple calling the item to be moved, and 4) redisplaying the tuple (or erasing and redisplaying 
entire relation). Note that the same steps and programs are used, but with different relationalstructures, 
 whether the moved item is an atom, a bolt, a chair, or a map symbol. Thus this operation and many others 
become general-purpose high-level tools for building application programs. RELATIONS EDITOR The picture 
building system provides a relations editor to interactively create, edit, and display relations. The 
relations editor works on both graphic and nongraphic terminals. Naturally a relation cannot be displayed 
graphically on a nongraphic terminal, but a list of the commands (line,text,area,etc.) that would be 
issued during display of a relation can be listed. A person using the relations editor will normally 
choose an editing function, then the relations editor will query the user for any information needed 
to carry out the function. One of the main functions of the relations editor is the production of relations 
for an application. The production of a relation consists of two steps: 1) defining the structure of 
the relation, and 2) adding tuples to the relation. The structure of a relation consists of some data 
describing the relation such as its name, number of domains, ordering, etc.; and a description of each 
domain. Fig. 5 - Correlation Example The domain descriptions consist of a name, a graphical meaning, 
a data type, and other similar information. The structure of a relation may be defined automatically,based 
on the type of data it is to hold, or domain by domain. If a relation is being defined domain by domain, 
then the relations editor will query the user for a description of each of the domains. Relations 
that can be defined automatically fall into one of the following three classes: 1) relations with basic 
graphical data, 2) relations that have calls to other relations, and 3) view relations. Relations with 
basic graphical data include relations to display lines, text, solid areas, etc. Relations that call 
other relations may have domains for specifying transformations, color, correlatability, etc. View 
relations have domains with graphical meanings that specify a mapping from the user space to the logical 
screen space. When defining a relationautomatically a user chooses one of the three classes of relations 
 listed above, and then the relations editor queries the user further for specific information. Once 
the structure of a relationhas been defined, then tuples may be added to that relation. Tuples may be 
typed in or added graphically to a relation. For example, to add a line to a relation, one could type 
in the tuple or just point to the desired end points on the display screen. The graphical editing of 
relations will be described in detail in a future paper. The relations editor also allows a user to 
read or write a number of relations or the entire data base from and to a disk file in human readable 
text format. This capability allows offline production and editing of relations by any standard text 
editor. Also, in order to provide a backup capability, machine independence, and protection against a 
data base whose internal structure may change, this capabilitywas found to be most useful and even necessary. 
 SAMPLE APPLICATIONS As stated before an application using the picture building system consists of two 
parts: application relations and application programs. Normally graphical information is stored in relations 
which can be created interactively by the relations editor and displayed by the interpreter. Alternatively, 
graphical information can be displayed directly through calls to DISPLIB. This section examines the 
relations and application programs for two simple applications. The first example application is a parts 
inventory system. Suppose one wished to computerize the information from a PIC parts catalog[10]. There 
are on the order of 10,000 parts in such a catalog. There are about 500 classes of parts such as a precision 
grooved pulley each of which consists of 20 (on the average) different parts. In the catalog there is 
one picture for each class of parts, which have several dimensions that are parameterized (each different 
part having different values for the parameters). For example, a picture of a gear wheel may be shown 
with parameters for radius and number of gear teeth. Along with each picture there is a table with a 
row for each part in that class. The table shows the part number, the price, and the drawing parameters 
for the part. An application is desired that would take as input the part number and would both output 
data on the part and would draw the part (and not just a generic parameterized drawing of that part 
as in the catalog). For most graphic data or base systems this would be difficult or impossible. 
With the picture building system one could store 500 parameterized relations to draw the pictures of 
 the parts. One would also need a relation, with one tuple per part, listing the part number, the price, 
the parameters for drawing the part, and a call to the relation that draws that part(one of the 500 
parameterized relations). This relation could be broken down, if desired, into one such relation for 
each class of part. An example class of parts is the swivel stud. A relation for the different swivel 
studs is shown in fig. 2b. The relation swivel stud1 is the parameterized relationwhich draws the swivel 
stud with parameters a,b,c,d. This relation could be produced, along with the relations for any other 
 class of parts, using the relations editor. Once this was done one could examine the data for any 
part or actually draw that part directly from the relations editor. these were If parts to be referenced 
often, then one might wish to write a simple application program to take input as the part number and 
display the part and information regarding that part. The output of such a program (about 20 statements 
in PL/I) is shown in fig. 6. Clearly the picture building system has simplified the writing of the 
application program, in fact it has all but eliminated the need to write an application program in 
this case. Another example application is a graphic chess moving program. At present the program allows 
two people to play chess using a color terminal. In the future it will allow a person to play against 
the computer. Fig. 7 shows the chess board but, since the actual board is red, white and blue, much information 
is lost with a black and white hard copy. There is one relation for each type of chess piece (pawn, 
king, etc.). An entirely different set of chess pieces could be created without effecting any application 
programs that use the chess board. Pieces are moved by pointing to squares on the screen. The chess 
moving program is less than 100 statements in PL/I. It is clear that having the graphic information 
stored in relations simplifies the task of application programming in the above cases. Also, since programs 
and data are independent, creating and managing the proper data and data structures is much simpler. 
 CONCLUSIONS Two dimensional graphics terminals are closer to the three dimensional world than one 
dimensional punched cards or printers, so it is obvious that graphic input and output can simplify almost 
any type of problem solving. The question is how to make effective use of graphics and how to avoid starting 
from scratch for each application. The picture building system provides general-purpose high-level 
graphics and data base support for programming. It allows data to be stored 188  Fig. 6 -Swivel 
Studs Fig. 7 -A Black and White Copy of a Red, White, and Blue Chess Board separately from programs 
in powerful but conceptually simple relations. Because the data is self-describing and independent of 
the accessing program, it is possible to supply application-independent programs that perform standard 
functions, thus greatly simplifying the creation of new applications. It is expected that any loss of 
machine efficiency due to generality will be more than compensated for by increased programming efficiency. 
 The picture building system is now working on a number of different computers, each supporting a variety 
of graphic and nongraphic terminals with a wide range of possible transmission-line speeds. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 EXPERIENCE WITH DISTRIBUTED PRCOESSING CN A HOST/SATELLITE GRAPHICS SYSTEM Janet Michel Andries van 
Dam Division of Applied Mathematics Erown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912 The prcblem cf 
distributing an application between two processors has been investigated by studying an interactive graphics 
application that isdivided between a time-shared host computer and a dedicated satellite system. The 
division of labor in the application is determined bya network flow assignment alqcrithm. The effect 
ofvariaticn in availability of the host computer on the distribution of the application is also studied. 
In particular, host availability is an important factor in determining the task distribution. As host 
availability decreased, procedures miqrate from the host to the satellite. 1 INTRODUCTIONANE BACKGRCUND 
 This paper describes actual experience with the problem of distributing an application system between 
a time shared host computer and a graphics satellite system as the CPU availability of the host processor 
varies. As a test case, statistics were gathered ona graphics application that is distributed between 
 an IBM S/36C-67 runninq the CP-67/CMS virtual machine time shairg system and the Brcn University Graphics 
System satellite [4]. These statistics were ther analyzed with a network flow assignment algorithm that 
produces the optimal assignment of the procedures in the application to either the host or the satellite. 
 The effect of variation in host availability on the distributicn of procedures is also studied. The 
term host availability is used tc mean the computational power presented by the time-shared host ccmputer 
to ar individual application program. The optimal distrituticn ofprocedures in a application distrituted 
between a host and satellite balances ccmmuricaticnlink cost and processing cost. As host availability 
decreases, the optimal distribution chanqes, and procedures migrate from the host to the satellite.

first section of this paper summarizes basic informationon the Erown University Graphics System (BUGS), 
the Interconnected Processor System (ICCPS) that performs the distributions, and the test case graphics 
application, HUGS. The next section describes the statistics gathering facilities in ICCPS. Secticn 
3 provides a general description of the network flow assignment alqcrithB and its implementation. 
The results of the test case experimentation are qiver in Section 4, and conclusions and suqqestions 
for further research are in Section 5.  1.1 The Erown University Graphics System The major components 
of BUGS are twc Digital Scientific Meta-4 micrcprcgrammed processors, called the Meta-4A and the Meta-4E, 
and a Vector General display. The Meta-4A is the main satellite  processor (CEU) and the Meta-4E is 
a display processor (DPU) with graphic instructions and a general purpose instruction set. Using a third 
micrcprcqrammed processor for real time transformaticns, windowing,and clipping, the DPU refreshes the 
Vector General from structured display files stored in shared core. The BUGS system is connected to the 
S/360-67 via a hiqh speed multiplexcr channel interface. The Meta-4A has a home grown S/360-like instructior 
set and a multitaskinq operatinq system. [ 1], [11]  1.2 The ICCPS Environment The Interconnected Prccessor 
System (ICCPS) [15], [91 is a tccl for simplifyirg the implemertaticn cf an applicaticn that is distributed 
over a sat cf interconnected computers. The chief characteristic of the ICCPS approach is that the 
systems over which an application is distributed are merqed into an apparert single system cn which 
 user programs are written. The motivation for the design of ICCPS was qenerated during several years 
experience with satellite qraphics.The ICCPS envircrment alleviates the fcllowing problems that freguently 
slow the implemertaticn of graphics application software: multiple languaqes, interprccesscrccmmunicaticns, 
 and the assignment cf prcqram procedures tc processors. The languaqe problem is solved byhaving a 
single source languaqe for all user proqrams and qeneratinq equivalent object ccde for both the host 
ccmputer and the satellite for any source prccedure. For this purpose, the Alqol W compiler [8] has 
been modified at Brcwn to qenerate code for the Meta-4A. Communication and procedure lccaticn are handled 
by the ICCPS run-time monitor. This monitor traps all interprccesscr procedure calls and handles all 
communication of parameters.1 The ICCPS mcnitcr alsc provides for run-time activation of procedures 
on either processor; the smallest unit of code which may execute on either processor is the procedure. 
Thus the actual prccess of allocating the procedures in the application between the two processors may 
be postponed from design and implementation time to application prcqramexecution time. Currently, the 
applicaticnprcqram user gives ccmmands to the ICCPS monitcr indicating which procedures are to be activated 
on which processor. However, this leaves the choice of determinirq the optimal distribution to the user. 
The task of findinq the optimal distributicr of procedures between the two processors is now being 
automated. The irtertion is to remove the burden of decision from the proorammer and allow to better 
 distribution decisions to be made.  1.3 The ApplicaticnSystem The qraphics application system, HUGS 
[91, [71, is a simple, two dimensional drafting packaqe that is distributed between a host processor 
and a satellite  graphics processor. The application data structure resides onthe host's secondary 
storaqe, and the qraphics display is available thrcugh the resources of the macro assemler languaqez 
commcn tc both satellite. HUGS was implemented in a the hcst and satellite. A conscious attempt was 
made to avcid makirq any unwarranted assumption as to the best distribution of the HUGS procedures. 
 HUGS was designed to be erccncmic; it has unlimited subpicturinq, windowing, levels of detail associated 
with each item in a picture, rejecticn options on all changes made to a picture, and constrained 
drawing using a variable size grid. The individual procedures of the HUGS application prcqram were classified 
into seven subsystems. The Mairline subsystem consists of three routines that are free to reside cn 
either prccessor. It interprets commands issued by the user and passes control tc the appropriate routine 
s). Mainline is called by the Attention Handler. The Atterticr Hardler is fixed on the satellite and 
decodes raw interruptsfrcm the various qraphic inputdevices. The Generatior subsystemconsists cf ten 
procedures that get items from the application data structure,perform clipping and viewpcrtinq, and generate 
display orders for the graphicsdata structure. Generation proceduresare free to reside cn either processor 
and are called by Mainline. The Updatesubsystem's procedures are also called byMainline: they implement 
adding lines, text, or subpictures, and movinq and deleting items, ir both the applicaticn data structure 
and the graphic data structure. There are seven Update procedures that are free to reside on either 
processor. All access to the application data structure stored cr the host is made through the Applicaticn 
Data Structure subsystem. These procedures are fixed on the host. All access tc the araphic display data 
structure is made through the Graphic Data Structure subsystem procedures. These prccedures, which add, 
delete, and attach graphic input devices to items in the picture, are fixed on the satellite. The final 
subsystem, the Calccmp Plottinq procedures, is fixed on the host. The fcllcwinq digram shows the subsystems 
in the HUGS applicaticn with lines representing the interactions between the prccedures in the subsystems.The 
procedures that are indicated as fixed on either the host or the satellite are fixed bynecessity because 
they contain peripheral device or operatinq system deperdert code.   2 DATA GATHERING After observing 
users how drafted pictures with BUGS,some scenarios typical of user activity were developed. Data was 
gathered by the ICCPS statistics package during repetiticr cf these scenarios and then analyzed. This 
statistical data is oriented toards resource requirements, including: time cf day, CEU clock time, commurication 
link start I/C's (i.e., the number of input or output initiations) and number of bytes transferred. 
In additicn, records of the cost charged to the user's account by the computer center and virtual machine 
paqing activity are gathered for the host. The ICCPS run-time monitor includes commands to specify the 
desired statistics and the names of the procedures tc be measured. The statistics specification is typed 
directly to the monitor by the user or can be read from a disk file. The statistics package also measures 
the resources used whenever the mcnitcr changes the distribution of the applicationprccedures. The statistics 
packaqe in ICCPS was designed with the qcals of source language independence and simplicity. ICCES provides 
a natural procedure-level breakpoint system that is invisible tc the prcgrammer at the source-lanquaqe 
 level. Its run-time monitor, which can trap all procedure calls, gathers informationon the resource 
requirements of any procedure. The run-time statistics are recorded as simply as possible sc that distortion 
cf the data introduced by the act ofmeasurement is mirimized. For every call and return, a statistics 
record ccntainirq data supplied by the operating systems is added to a trace file. A separate prcgram, 
Clcthc3, collects static data frcm the cbject code libraries containinq the application. Static data 
includes size, arameter descripticn, and the external prccedure references made by each procedure. After 
the applicaticn prcqram has run, dyramic trace file data and static data are summed and averaged by Iachesis 
tc prcduce the fcllcwinq information about the application fcr the entire qathering period: response 
time and "user think time" data, a descripticn ofprocedure interacticn, and input for more ccmplex analysis 
as described ir the next section. 3 DATA ANALYSIS Static data from Clcthc and dynamic data from the 
trace file are combined into a procedure interaction data structure by a separate prcgram, Laches-s. 
Different subroutines examine this data structure and prepare formatted input for analysis prcgrams that 
find the best distributicr of rocedures between the two processors. Cne subroutine provides data in the 
form of a modified commodity network graph for analysis by a network flcw assignment algorithm. Another 
formats data for Eestdist, a subfunction of Foley's qeneral purpose graphics modelinq system [41. The 
Eestdist analysis generates a set of possible distributions and then evalvates the performance of each 
distribution with a queuing network model. It uses a backtrack algorithm that solves the more difficult 
problem by allcing for memory constraints as well as variable computation and communication time costs. 
The approach taken in the Erown experiments has been tc verify results of the flow analysis method byrunning 
the correspcndinq data thrcugh Bestdist. 3.1 The Network Flow Assiqnment Analysis A modular application 
system that is distributed betweentwc prccessors can be modelled as a modified commodity network graph. 
The problem of finding an assignment of procedures to processors that minimizes the cost of both computation 
and interprocessor ccmmunicaticn is then solved by applying a maximum flow-minimum cut alqorithm [31. 
The theory tehird the model and a complete description of the alqcrithm are in [121. Basically, the maximum 
flow-minimum cut alqcrithm determines a maximum flow throuqh a network qraph from one point tc another 
when the branches of the graph are subject to capacity limitations. Acutset of the graph is a  partiticr 
that severs the scurce mode frcm the destination node; the capacity of the cutset is the sum cf the capacities 
cf the individual cut branches. The maximum flow-minimum cut alqcrithm finds the cutset of the graph 
 that has the minimum capacity. That minimum capacity represents the bottleneck that bcunds the maximal 
flcw of the entire network. One distribution of procedures between the twc processors is fine fcr the 
session measured, but what happens tc the distriuticn as host CEU availability changes? How stable is 
a distribution, that is. will a slight change in the host performance cause the distributicr tc change? 
By extrapolating from the measured data, the range of host CPU availability within which a distribution 
is optimal can be determined. Ic dc this, the measured host execution time must be The main advantage 
cf retwork flow analysis is that it is easy to change the basis for optimization. For example, by replacing 
the ccmputaticn data with monetary cost data, a distribution can be found that talances ccmnunicaticn 
link charges, charges for host usage, and any charges for satellite usage. In additicn, the weight cf 
the cutset prcduced by the maximum flow alqcrithm is useful as a prediction of the respcnse time or cost 
of the distributicn. Acccrdinq to a theorem by Stone, "The weight of a cutset of the mcdified craph is 
equal to the cost of the ccrrespcndinq module assignment." [121 The main prcblem with the ccmmcdity 
flcw graph model is allcwinq for constraints on satellite memory. If the cptimal distribution does not 
fit in the satellite's memory, then the next best distribution must be found. If the satellite operating 
system allcws dynamic loading cf prccedures, then a factor must be added tc the satellite execution time 
of procedures that must beloaded into core. An alqcrithm for findirq the next best soluticn has recently 
been devised but has not yet been tested [131. Another possible problem is that the model assumes that 
the communication cost between the twc prccesscrs is symmetric. For the Erown confiquration, the cost 
cf transferrinq data from the host processor to the satellite is the same as the cost of transferrinq 
data from the satellite to the host. 3.2 Implementaticn cf the Assignment Analysis Atropos is a program 
that prepares a modified commodity network graph from the qathered data and analyzes it with the network 
flow assiqnment alqcrithm. For response time optimization, data on the branches from a procedure node 
to the two processor nodes is the total executicr time for the procedure on each processor. Data on 
the branches between procedure nodes (A and B) is a function of the fcllowing: the speed of the communication 
 link, the total length of the parameter list, the number of times A called B, and overhead for link 
input/cutput initiations.  normalized to represent a dedicated CPU. The measured host execution time 
data for each procedure is multiplied by the ratic of the calculated execution time to the measured execution 
time fcr a special benchmark procedure. Next the ncrmalized executicn time data is multiplied by an arbitrary 
host CPU deqradaticn factor, F. For F equal tc one, the host is dedicated: for F equal to 1.5, the host 
availability is degraded by fifty percent. The critical values of this factor, that is, the pcints at 
which a change in host availabilitynecessitates a redistributicr, are determined by performing a bisection 
search on the set of possible rccedure distributions obtained by varyinq F. The result of this search 
is a library cf distributicns where each distribution is associated with a ranqe cf host deqradaticn 
factors within which a distribution is optimal. This range is a measure cf the stability of the distribution. 
 4 SUMMARY CF RESUITS Data from a general sceneric that exercised all the procedures in the application 
was analyzed both by the network flow assignment method, Atrcpcs, and tv Eestdist. The results frcm the 
Atropos analysis agreed with the results from the Bestdist analysis on the same data with the same communication 
link speed. In addition, data from several different scendrios was analyzed by Atrcpcs. The resulting 
distributions cf prccedures between the satellite and the host, and the corresponding ranqes of host 
execution speeds within which the distributicn is optimal, were studied. The average response time predictions 
produced by the aralysis were verified by the measured average response time from the scenario data. 
The averaqe measured response time is the average clock time starting on a call to the mainline procedure 
by the interrupt handler and ending cn the return of the mainline procedure. With a dedicated host 
the optimal distritution assigns all free procedures except one tc the 4 . As host availability decreases, 
prccecures miqrate to the satellite. In qerral, prccedures tend to cluster and move as grcups. These 
grcups are lccal regicns cf high interaction activity. This tendency was alsc noticed by [5]. It is not 
surprisinq to note that these qroups ccrrespond tc the subsystems that were created during the design 
of EUGS. In an application with a wider ranqe cf procedure interaction and less clustering, prccedures 
wculd prcbably tend to move individually. The order in which qroups cf procedures moved to the satellite 
was consistert for all the scenaries. Prccedures in the Update subsystem that were used during the scenaric 
moved before the Generation procedures since Update prccedures make heavy use of fixed satellite routines. 
 The ranqe cf hcst executicr speeds within which a distributicn is optimal varies with the scenario. 
For example, in a scenario that emphasizes picture drawing and rarely regenerates the picture, more host 
degradation is needed before the generaticn procedures will move off the host. Since the user can assign 
procedures to processors with the ICCES mcnitor commands, it is pcssible to attempt to find an optimal 
distributicn of procedures by hard, without an analysis routine. This involves trying different configurations 
during a relatively constant pericd cf host availabilityand then examinind the measured response time 
data. Befcre the assignment algorithm was implemeented, a distributicr cf prccedures identical tc one 
of the theoretical distributicns was derived in this way; however, the effect of host availability 
on the distribution cannot be determined by hand and is not cbvicus frcm the measured data. An optimization 
fcr cost was also done by using ccst functions fcr hcst and ccmmunicaticn link usage with no charge for 
satellite usaqe. The results vacillated between a distribution with all procedures on the satellite 
and a distribution with all except Generation procedures on the satellite. There is a delicate balance 
between link charges and host charges. The effect cf different ccmmunication link speeds on the distributicn 
of  prccedures could alsc be studied by hclding execution time data ccnstant, varying the link speed 
by a factor and searchinq for critical values of the factor. This kind of optimizaticn is necessary 
for designing a new host/satellite system rather than for distributing applicaticns cc an existing 
 satellite system. General purpose modelling cf satellite qraphics configurations is done more thoroughly 
by [4].  5 CCNCIUSICNS A fixed library cf prccedure  distributions associated with typical host load 
factors is prcbablysufficient fcr use in periodically shifting procedures tc achieve cptimal response 
time for the average user. Before automatic redistribution usinq such libraries is implemented, further 
study is needed to determine sufficiently accurate run-time measures cf host CPU availability for use 
in the analysis algorithm. In addition, the balance between the ccst of reccnfigurationwith the benefits 
cf better response time must be considered. Currently, better methcds are being developed tc measure 
and predict host availability in the Erown CP-67/CMS virtual machine ervironment. [21 In contrast tc 
 the use cf fixed  libraries, it be would desirable to custom fit the distributicn cf procedures to 
the user activity at run-time. This would entail the gatherirq cf data, computing the best distribution 
of procedures, and then changing the distributions cf procedures at run-time. Further study is reeded 
tc determine the feasibility, computational expense and optimal frequency cf run-time redistribution.[10] 
 The network flow assignment algorithm has proved tc be an excellent method for assigninq procedures 
to two prccessors and studying the effect of hcst  availability on the migration of procedures. Even 
if run time data is not available, the network flow assignment algorithm could be useful for distributing 
an application between two processors. A qccd estimate cf parameter length information and the execution 
time of procedures cr each prccesscr wculd produce a near optimal distribution. [12] Moreover, an automated 
analysis methcdolcqv is essential fcr choosing distributions since the ad bcc judqements of users and 
designers are notoriously poor and time ccrsuming. For example, in a hypothetical distributed graphics 
application system frcm an earlier paper [151, it was predicted that display code generaticn prccedures 
wculd be the first tc move tc the satellite. Fcr the HUG applicaticn system, it turned cut that the 
cppcsite is true. Since there is less ccmmunication link usage transferring a compact display tuffer 
than transferring items frcm the data structure in the HUGS applicaticn, display code qeneraticr prccedures 
are the last qrcup tc move tc the satellite. insure the best Ic distributicn of prccedures, it is essential 
tc autcmate the prccess cf determininq optimal distributicns of procedures between processcrs. ACKNCWIEDGMENT

			<par><![CDATA[This paper advocates a configurable approach to software for satellite graphics in which the division of labor between the host and satellite computers can be easily changed after an application program has been written. A software system, CAGES (Configurable Applications for Graphics Employing Satellites), implements this approach. CAGES can substantially simplify the application programmer's task of programming a host and satellite computer by making the intercomputer interface relatively invisible to him, while at the same time allowing him the efficiency and flexibility that can result from direct application programming of the satellite computer.Proper design of configurable programs is facilitated by a mathematical model defining a pairwise measure of program module inter-dependence. Experience with this model has resulted in a set of programming guidelines that further aid the application programmer in producing a suitable program structure.]]></par>

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania CONFIGURABLE APPLICATIONS FOR SATELLITE GRAPHICS Griffith 
HAMLIN, Jr. Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering Hampton, Virginia 23665 This 
paper advocates a configurable approach to software for satellite graphics in which the division of labor 
between the host and satellite computers can be easily changed after an application program has been 
written. A software system, CAGES (ConfigurableApplications for Graphics Employing Satellites), im­plements 
this approach. CAGES can substantially simplify the applicationprogrammer's task of programming a host 
and satellite computer by making the intercomputer interface relatively invisible to him, while at the 
same time allowing him the efficiency and flexibility that can result from direct application program­ 
ming of the satellite computer. Proper design of configurable programs is facilitated by a mathematical 
model defining a pairwise meas­ure of program module inter-dependence. Experience with this model has 
resulted in a set of programming guidelines that further aid the application programmer in producing 
a suitable program structure. 1. INTRODUCTION Computer graphics installations often employ a two-computer 
complex,consistings of a smaller satellite computer connected to a larger host com­puter. The intercomputer 
link can range from a low speed telephone line (300-9600 baud) to a very fast I/O channel connection 
(greater than 300,000 baud). Two basic categories of software designs for such satellite graphics installationsare 
dis­cernible: "fixed-function"and "programmable­ satellite" systems. In fixed-functionsystems the satellite 
computer and intercomputer channel appear to the applica­ tion programmer as a "black box" that is accessed 
by subroutine calls from the host computer. All application-specificcode is host-resident. Only a fixed 
set of general purpose functions, chosen by the graphics installation's software developer, is satellite-resident. 
This approach relieves the application programmer of many of the burdens of programming two computers 
and is quite suitable for certain classes of application. Programmable-satellitesystems allow the applica­tion 
programmer to directly program the satellite computer. Existing examples [1,2] of such sys­tems allow 
the programmer flexibility in choosing a division of labor optimized for his particular application. 
They do not relieve him of the  burdens of consciously programmingtwo computers although they do reduce 
these burdens considerably. The advantages and disadvantages of these two gen­eral classes of satellite 
graphics software are discussed in [3,4,10] and will not be repeated here.  2. THE CONFIGURABLEPROGRAM 
APPROACH We desire an approach that eliminates from the application code all explicit references to 
the two computers, and yet, at the same time, allows the application programmer to directly program the 
 satellite. This paper advocates such an approach to software for satellite graphics, known as the configurable 
program approach [3]. The fundamen­ tal notion of the configurable program approach is that the application 
programmer may choose the di­vision of labor between the host and satellite computers after the application 
is coded. Thus all application source program modules must be executable on either computer. If this 
is not achieved, the programmer's choice of divisions of labor is reduced. The actual binding-time of 
this division of labor depends upon the implementation of this approach, but the division of labor is 
easily changed, even after it has been initially bound. Such a change may require recompiling the application, 
or it may only require requesting the change to an on-line monitor during execution. It never requires 
the programmer to change any of the application, except, of course, for re-specifying the desired division 
of labor. The configurable program approach alleviatesmany of the complications introduced by direct 
applica­tion programming of the satellite. First, the di­vision of labor between the two computers need 
not be completely determined at design time. This is  196 desirable because the amounts of CPU time 
and other resources required by each application com­ ponent are difficult to determine during the 
design process.  Second, the configurable program approach relies inherentlyon one programming language, 
since the same source program is required to run on either computer. Thus the bilingual requirement on 
the programmer, often present in other programmable satellite approaches [1,2], is necessarily elima­ted. 
Third, the application programmer does not explicitly program intercomputercommunications. They are automatically 
provided by the system upon references to procedures or data elements which are not resident on the referencing 
computer. The programmer continues to use the familiar sub­routine call and data reference to implicity 
initiate the communications.  3. CAGES OVERVIEW To demonstrate the effectiveness of the configur­ able 
approach in simplifying the programmer's task and to better understand the design decision alternatives 
involved in a implementation of the approach, the CAGES Systemwas implemented at the University of 
North Carolina. It is fully des­ cribed elsewhere by Hamlin and Foley [4]. Briefly, CAGES was implemented 
on the U.N.C. satellite graphics system consisting of an IBM 360/75 host computer, a PDP-11/45 satellite 
computer with 28K words of main memory and a fixed head disk, a Vector General 3-D interactive display, 
and a high speed selector channel interface. Application programs are written in a modular fashion, as 
if all modules were going to be resident on one computer. The application programmer then specifies 
to CAGES which modules are to be host­ resident and which are to be satellite-resident. All modules that 
are potentially satellite­resident may use only a subset of PL/I known as PLCD [5,6]. CAGES arranges 
for the modules to execute according to the specified configuration, and provides the program with a 
virtual single computer with dual CPUs. To maintain this virtual machine, CAGES provides three types 
of services:  1. Calls from one computer may be made to subroutines resident in the other computer. 
The execution of such a remote subroutine call triggers intercomputer communicationsby the system to 
cause program control and parameter values to be transmitted between computers. If the call so specifies, 
the calling program can continue execu­ting, allowing simultaneous execution of the sub­routines. Such 
multiprocessingis severely limited in the current implementation of CAGES. Due to the use of a uni-programmingsatellite 
operating system, no sequence of calls is allowed which implies the simultaneous execution of more than 
one satellite-residentsubroutine. Also, subroutines executing simultaneouslyon different computers may 
not change the values of shared data. These limitations are only a function of the current implementationand 
not inherent in the configurable programming approach.  2. An asynchronous interrupt (e.g. a PL/I CONDITION)may 
occur on one computer for which the associated interrupt handling subroutine (e.g. PL/I ON-BLOCK) is 
resident on the other computer.  3. Data with EXTERNAL scope may be referenced from program modules 
on both computers. If this occurs, the data is known as GLOBAL data. At the left of FIGURE 1 are shown 
CAGES applica­tion programs written as if they were going to be resident on only one computer. The programmer 
also supplies extended declarations specifying a particular configurationof the application. These declarations 
and the source code are input to a pre-processor written for CAGES. The pre­processor changes some of 
the source code slightly, generates some PL/I source procedures itself, and produces three files. One 
contains procedures destined for the host, one contains procedures destined for the satellite, and one 
contains symbol table entries for GLOBAL variables. The (modified) source procedures are then compiled 
by either the PL/I-F compiler (host procedures) or the PLCD compiler (satellite procedures). Finally, 
the loaders of each computer combine the CAGES run-time system with the object modules produced  by 
the compile steps to produce two executable load modules. In the course of maintaining a single virtual 
computer for the application  program, the CAGES run-time system initiates and controls all intercomputer 
communications. Another implementation of the configurable program approach, by van Dam, Harrington, 
and Stabler [7,8], is known as ICOPS. It uses differ­ ent criteria and techniques. ICOPS programs are 
 limited to subroutine calls and parameter passing for inter-computercommunications, but the division 
of labor can be changed dynamically at run-time, and ICOPS is not tied to any specified language. CAGES 
programs have richer inter­ computer communicationcapabilities and are written in PL/I, but actually 
changing a program's division of labor requires at least a partial recompilation. Because CAGES does 
not assume anything about the applications it supports, except that they are written in a subset of 
PL/I, the system's ideas are equally applicable to non-graphics programs which must for some reason 
execute in the memories of a two-computer network. One network distributed processing system is the 
Resource Sharing Executive (RSEXEC) [9], described by Thomas in 1973. It is a distributed executive 
system which runs on the TENEX operating system of PDP-10 host computers on the ARPANET. Its goal is 
to facili­ tate the sharing of resources among the host of the ARPANET by making invisible to the user 
the distinction between a local TENEX virtual machine and remotely located one. CAGES has a similar 
goal of trying to make the host-satellite configuration appear to the application program as one computer 
with one main memory. RSEXEC allows a program on one host to access files and I/O devices anywhere 
in the network in such a way that inter-host boundaries are invisible. CAGES applies this same notion 
to GLOBAL data and remotely located subroutines by allowing access to them from either computer in a 
manner making the actual location of these objects transparent to the applicationprogram. 4. GRAPH 
MODEL Some program structures are well suited for distributed execution and some are not. To aid in 
understanding what types of structures are best suited for configurable programs, a graph model of a 
distributed application has been defined, and is fully described by Hamlin [10]. Briefly, each applicationmodule 
is represented by a node of the graph. An edge exists between node i and node j if module i may call 
module j during execution. This model tries to measure a property of the structure of the program relating 
to its suit­ability for distributed execution among two or more computer memories. It does not measure 
the performance of the program. Hence it has no input parameters describingmodule execution times on 
different computers. It does measure the amount of interaction that exists between each pair of modules 
by measuring the execution over­head that would be caused if the modules in each pair were placed on 
separate computers. This overhead due to a program's distribution is assumed to be composed of: (a) the 
cost to send parameters and other needed data between  computers, incurred each time a module is called 
or returns across the computer boundary; (b) the cost to fetch from the remote computer any GLOBAL data 
items needed by a module, incurred each time a module references a GLOBAL data item which is resident 
on a remote computer. To calculate this overhead the model's parameters include the following: (a) A 
description of the program's flow of control among the nodes.  (b) A cost associated with each pair 
of nodes. The cost is incurred each time one node transfers control to the other.  (c) A cost associated 
with each GLOBAL data item. This cost is incurred upon each access to the GLOBAL data item when the preceeding 
access  to that GLOBAL data item was made from the opposite computer. (d) The probability that each 
node will access each GLOBAL data item. The application programmermay estimate these parameters or 
he may execute the application with any configuration and allow CAGES to collect execution data from 
which they may be calculated. The particular cost function used to determine the cost parameters is 
left to the programmer. He may, for example, choose the cost associated with a GLOBAL data item to equal 
the time required to transfer that GLOBAL data item between computers, or he may choose its cost to be 
the number or words of intercomputer communicationsgenerated by a transfer of the GLOBAL data item. 
 From this information a "nearness measure" between every pair of modules is calculated, inde­pendent 
of any particular module distribution. The resulting nearness matrix represesnts, for each pair of program 
modules, the execution over­head cost which would be incurred if the two modules were placed on separate 
computers. For any configuration,the sum of the nearness measures between all pairs of separated modules 
is the predicted execution-timeoverhead cost caused by the distributed processing. An algorithm, such 
as that described by Ford and Fulkerson [11] in 1962, could be used with this model to find the configuration 
causing the least overhead expenditure, given that two particular nodes must be separated. However, the 
Ford- Fulkerson algorithm allows no module placement constraints, such as satellite memory limitations, 
 which limit the number of nodes that can be placed in one of the partitions. Dealing with such satellite 
memory limitations and other constraints is part of the problem of choosing a suitable configuration. 
Recent work by Stone [12] may prove useful in automatically configuring an application,although his 
approach also ignores constraints on memory sizes. When designing a distributedapplication, the programmer 
should consider any proposed applica­tion structure in terms of its expected inter­computer overhead. 
 To aid in this task, several commonly occurring structure-relatedsituations in satellite graphics programs 
have been identifiedand analyzed with the model. The  result is a set of structuring guidelines which 
is fully described by Hamlin [10]. The guidelines are not unexpected. They verify one's intuition. More 
importantly, they give a quantitative measure of the relative advantage of one technique over another 
in a given programming situation. As an example of such a situation analyzed by the model, suppose a 
certain program module, A, has a large nearness measure with most of the other modules, causing considerable 
run-time overhead no matter in which computer it resides. A lower­level service routine might exhibit 
this charac­teristic. It may be advantageous to duplicate module A on both computers. This eliminates 
all intercomputer transfer of control which would have occurred when modules remotely called A. However, 
module A may itself call other modules. Duplica­ting module A causes one copy of module A to be remotely 
located from all modules it calls. Also,  module A may use some STATIC data (PL/I termology) which 
must be transferred between computers each time a different copy of module A is activated. These two 
considerationsmay add to the execution overhead if module A is duplicated. Hence it is not always advantageous 
to duplicatemodule A. Suppose we know the following parameters: P = fraction of the invocations of 
module A which are satellite-resident. F = (program model path costs for all execu­tion paths which 
end with module A and whose beginning module and next-to-last module are on opposite computers) divided 
by (costs of all paths which end with module A). I = fraction of the invocations of A which are not 
on the same computer as was the previous invocation of A. H1 = sum of nearness measures between A and 
all host-residentmodules which call A (directly or indirectly). S14= sum of nearness measures between 
A and all satellite-resident modules which call A. N = nearness measure of A with itself. A relatively 
straightforward analysis given in [10] concludes that duplication of module A is advantageous if:  
That is, if this condition is met, the model's prediction of overhead cost will be less if module A is 
duplicated than if module A is placed on either the host or satellite computers (assum­ ing all other 
modules remain fixed).  5. EXPERIMENTALUSE OF CAGES Results of two interactive application programs 
run under CAGES are presented here. These appli­ cations were run to test: 1. The ease of using the 
system and of reconfiguring a program.  2. The accuracy of the model in predicting system overhead. 
 3. The effect on performance of different distributions of an application.  4. The effect on performance 
of different program structures for an application.  5. The usefulness of the model's nearness measures 
in suggesting suitable program structures  A particular set of input data and user responses was selected 
for each application. Each set was designed to exercise the various modules of the applicationin a 
manner similar to the applica­ tion's "typical" use. This same set of data was always used with each 
run of teh application. Sixteen runs were made with the first applica­ tion, MEDICS. Fifteen runs were 
made with BLOCKS, the second application. These runs were approxi­mately equally divided among the various 
configu­ rations tested for each application. During each run, response times and intercomputer channel 
usage data were collected by the CAGES run-time system. The data items collected were: (a) "Average 
response time" -the average real time measured from the time the user inputs a response (pushes a PFK 
key, etc.) until the next display is shown to him and all activity in the entire system is suspended, 
awaiting his next response. (b) "Host CPU-time" -the average amount of CPU-time per user interaction 
used by the host computer.  (c) "CAGES host CPU-time" -the average portion of the host CPU-time which 
was spent in CAGES run-time modules.  (d) "Percent of CAGES overhead" -the CAGES host CPU-time divided 
by host CPU-time.  (e) "Message words" -the average number of 16-bit words of intercomputer traffic 
per inter­action.  (f) "Predictedwords" -the number of message words predicted by the model.  (g) "Host 
elapsed time" -the amount of real time per interaction during which control was resident in the host 
computer. It does not include the time when the host was only waiting for the satellite computer to perform 
some tasks and return.  (h) "Elapsed time" -the average real time per interaction, not counting time 
the entire system was idle, waiting for the user's next input  The several computer runs were made 
at various times of the day and night throughout a fall semester at U.N.C. The maximum variation in per­formance 
data obtained between any two of these runs was only 10%. This includes two runs made in "stand-alone"mode 
with no other users on the host computer. We attribute this low variation to the U.N.C. computer center's 
policy which gives graphics jobs extremely high priority. The performancedata given in this section are 
median values of all runs. FIRST APPLICATION: MEDICS MEDICS is an interactive curve fitting application 
designed to fit a function to a given set of exponentially decaying input data points. Written in 1970 
to run on a single computer, MEDICS does not, in its original version, possess a structure designed for 
distributed execution. The basic modular structure of MEDICS is shown in FIGURE 2. After each step in 
the solution process, results are displayed to the user, usually in the form of a graph. After analyzing 
the graph, the user inputs parameters to the next step. Each of the main-line modules of MEDICS contains 
both calculations required by one solution step and calls to a set of graphical subroutines written especially 
for MEDICS, to create a display of the results of the step. The only changes made to MEDICS to run it 
under CAGES were to replace calls to the IBM subroutinepackage designed for the 2250 display (in use 
at U.N.C. when MEDICS was written) by calls to a locally written subroutine package for the current Vector 
General display unit. This required changes only in the display modules and the addition of some code 
in module ATTN to perform functions originally provided by the 2250 hardware. An existing application 
was selected to measure the improvement (if any) in performance resulting from changes made to its structure 
as a result of applicationof the model. Applicationof the model to the original MEDICS structure shows 
large  nearness measures among the graphics subroutines, making it unreasonable to place any of these 
modules on separate computers. Also, each of the 14 main-line modules contains large floating point 
calculations which makes it unreasonable to place these modules on the U.N.C. satellite computer. Due 
to the foregoing considerations,a configura­ tion that placed all the graphics modules on the satellite 
and all other modules on the host appeared to be the best configuration of the original MEDICS modular 
structure implementable at the U.N.C. installation. A configurationwhich placed all application dependent 
code on the host appeared to be the only other reasonable imple­mentable configurationof this original 
MEDICS structure. In this configuration,only module ATTN was satellite-resident. ATTN only inter­ cepts 
low level graphics inputs and refreshes the display (formerly done in IBM 2250 hardware). ATTN must be 
satellite-residentto accomplish these functions. The data from these two con­figurations are shown in 
the first two columns of Table 1. The column labeled Host represents the configura­tion which placed 
all modules but ATTN on the host computer. The column labeled Distributed repre­sents the other configuration. 
 For the "Host" configuration,the relevant near­ness measures (between ATTN and everything else) predicted 
the amount of CPU-time overhead and intercomputer traffic correctly within 8.6%. The average  user 
response time with this configuration was 3.3 seconds. In the "distributed" configurationthe display 
 program is built on the satellite. Therefore small display program changes made as a result of user 
inputs do not necessitate its transfer from the host computer as in the "host" configuration. This was 
expected to decrease response time for minor inputs. It did in fact decrease the amount of data transferred 
between computers by approximately 30%. However, due to the extremely fast data rate of the U.N.C. host-satellite 
communications link (selector channel speed), this reduction made little differ­ence in response times. 
Increased CPU overhead by CAGES to format a large number of short messages compensated for the reduction 
in data. The resulting response time was 3.32 seconds, approxi­ mately the same as in the "host" configuration. 
 With data gathered by CAGES it is possible to calculate the response times that would be incurred with 
any given transmission speed. At 2400 baud, for example, the MEDICS response time would have been 7.15 
seconds for the "host" configuration and 6 seconds for the "distributed" configuration,a 19% improvement 
due to reduced intercomputer traffic. The nearness matrix indicates that the original structure of 
MEDICS is not well suited to distri­buted execution. Indeed, the "distributed" configurationhad considerableoverhead. 
 This is basically because MEDICS was designed for one computer. Most notably, 12 of the 14 main line 
modules contain both large calculations and graphic input/output. The nearness matrix shows that several 
main-line modules are much nearer the graphics modules than to each other. Therefore  they should have 
been placed on the satellite computer, perhaps replacing several graphical modules with smallest nearness 
measure. Since this was precluded by the large floating point  Table 1 MEDICS PERFORMANCE 200 calculations 
performed in these modules, they were rewritten. Blocks of source code in each module which contained 
only calculations, and blocks which contained only graphics related code, were identified. Each module 
was restructuredinto two modules, one containing the calculations and the other containing the graphics 
related code. Essentially the same set of source statements was reused, but the statementswere combined 
into modules differently. The nearness measures from this new MEDICS struc­ture indicate that five 
of the newly created graphics modules have a much larger total near­ness measure to the graphics subroutines 
than to their associated calculation modules. However, due to memory requirements, not all five can be 
accommodated in the satellite. It was necessary to place 2 of these modules on the host. A smaller module 
was moved to the satellite in their place The resulting configurationhas 4 of the newly created modules 
and the graphical subroutine on the satellite. Its performance is given in the "restructured"column 
of Table 1. The average response time per user interaction was 1.69 seconds with this configuration,about 
twice as fast as the two configuration of the original MEDICS structure. This restructuring of the MEDICS 
application produced a much larger change in performance than between the two diffe­rent configurations 
of the same original struc­ture, even for a 2400 baud intercomputer link. It forcefully illustrates the 
importance of giving careful thought to the program structure at design time to accommodate likely configura­tions. 
 SECOND APPLICATION: BLOCKS BLOCKS [14] is an applicationprogram designed for the purpose of creating 
and manipulating block diagrams such as electronic schematics and program flowcharts. FIGURE 3 represents 
the basic modular structure of BLOCKS.  EDIT supervises control among the various editing functions. 
Each of 5 function modules controls one of the 5 basic capabilities supportedby BLOCKS. Module ADD adds 
a block to a diagram, DELETE deletes a block, CONECT connects two blocks with a straight line, MTEXT 
adds or changes text labeling a block, and CPAGE changes among pages of large diagrams. Each function 
module calls upon LSMOD, TSMOD, and PSMOD to access and modify the three data structures describing the 
diagram being built. In addition, the function modules call upon module DPMAIN and its subordinate modules 
(GETEXT,MOVEIN,TEMPLT) to generage Vector General display programs to draw pictures of diagrams being 
built. Finally, all modules call upon module INTACT when they wish some input from the user at the CRT 
display. INTACT also provides low level feedback to the user. From the BLOCKS nearness matrix, it was 
discovered that 56% of the total value in the entire matrix was contained in nearness measures among 
the three modules DPMAIN, MOVEIN, and CONECT. There­fore these three should always be placed on the same 
computer. However, two factors make this impossible. First, some of the modules can reside on only one 
computer. Modules INTACT, MOVEIN, and VRESET must be satellite-residentto access the CRT display hardware 
and its program buffer in satellite memory. Second, the transferrable modules of interest (EDIT, DPMAIN, 
ADD, DELETE, CONECT, MTEXT, CPAGE) are all rather large. After accommodatingmodules required to be satellite­resident, 
satellite memory constraints allow only one transferable module to be made satellite­resident. Thus we 
are not able to place both DPMAIN and CONECT on the satellite with MOVEIN. There are four configurationsof 
BLOCKS that appeared to be reasonable and implementable. Modules DPMAIN and CONECT were each placed 
separately on the satellite in two of these configurations. Performance data for these four configurationsare 
given in Table 2. The first configuration (configuration1, Table 2) placed on the satellite only the 
three modules that must be satellite-resident. It produced a 1.5 second average response time. When 
DPMAIN was made satellite-resident,while leaving EDIT host­resident (configuration 2, Table 2), the response 
time improved by 10%. Placing EDIT on the satellitewithout DPMAIN (configuration 3, Table 2) increased 
response time 30%. When CONECT was placed on the satellite alone (configuration 4, Table 2) its separation 
from DPMAIN negated an improvement that might have come from placing OPMAIN and INTACT together. Response 
time did not change significantly from the third configuration.  6. CONCLUSIONS Several conclusions 
are drawn from the two experi­mental applications. First, analyzing the applica­tion structure and modifying 
it accordingly at design time to accommodate likely configurations is very useful. When this was done 
to MEDICS, a decrease in overhead and a 49% improvement in response time resulted. Data from the model 
helped to produce an efficient structure and configuration.  Table 2 BLOCKS PERFORMANCE The configuration 
of BLOCKS predicted as optimal by the model was slightly too large (10%) for the available satellite 
memory, so it could not be tried. However, the time savings of a predicted 383 words of intercomputer 
communicationsin this configuration should give an advantage of 2.14 seconds of response at 2400 baud 
when compared to the first configurationof BLOCKS. Based on comments from the BLOCKS programmers and 
from the author's experience in restructuring MEDICS, the configurable programming approach is almost 
as simple to program as a fixed function satellite approach. Except for efficiency consid­erations, the 
two-computer network is hidden from the applicationprogrammer. Therefore the coding tasks are of approximately 
the same complexity in both approaches. However, with the configurable approach, the applicationprogrammer 
must design the modular structure of the application care­fully and he must choose a configuration of 
the modules. Hence, there is marginally more work involved in writing a configurable application than 
in writing an application for a fixed func­tion satellite. The opinion of the BLOCKS programmers was 
that the elimination of direct application programmer coding of the intercomputer communications is 
a major advantage of the con­figurable program approach, especially for appli­ cations in which remotely 
called modules in turn call other remotely located modules. The associa­ted communications, if written 
directly by the application programmer, would be quite tedious. The BLOCKS programmers noted an unexpected 
debug­ging aid in the configurable programming approach Due to the availabilityof satellite on-line debugging 
aids and procedures at the University of North Carolina graphics installation, it is easier to debug 
a module if it is satellite­resident. The easy reconfigurability of CAGES programs allows a module being 
debugged to be placed by itself on the satellite. There it can be interactively debugged. After debugging, 
the module may be placed on the host or satellite according to other criteria. The major cause of errors 
and delays when recon­figuring BLOCKS and MEDICS was slight differences in the syntax of the two versions 
of PL/I in use on the host and satellite computers. Use of a single compiler with two sets of code generators 
 202 for the host and satellite would eliminate this problem. Also any object code generated to handle 
configuragle system functions, such as message formatting and data translation, would surely be more 
efficient than the source code generated for that purpose by the CAGES pre­ processor approach.  7. 
SUMMARY In summary, the use of CAGES suggests that con­ figurable applications show much better perfor­ 
mance when their structure is designed with distributed execution in mind. Changing among different 
configurations of a given structure in an effort to tailor the division of labor to the individual 
application can increase performance. Thirty percent variation among the configurations of BLOCKS was 
observed. Furthermore, the config­ urable program approach to software for satellite graphics can provide 
a simplification to the application programmer's task of programming two computers that approaches 
the simplification obtained with the fixed-function satellite approach. Data from the CAGES implementation 
indicate that the configurableprogram approach is a viable approach to software support for interactive 
satellite graphics applications. The configurable program approach can be extended to more general 
networks of N computers. Also, more general multiprocessingshould be possible using this approach than 
is found in the CAGES implementation. REFERENCES [1] I. W. Cotton, Language for graphic attention

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania REMOTE PROGRAMMABILITYOF GRAPHIC INTERACTIONS IN A HOST/SATELLITECONFIGURATION 
 Samuel D. Moulton Philip J. Corman Digital Equipment Corporation Maynard, Mass. This paper describes 
the remote programmabilityof graphic-oriented interactions in a large, time­shared host/multiple-satelliteconfiguration. 
The philosophy and architecture of a pseudo machine the Programmable Graphics Processor (PGP) --is presented 
along with a description of the higher­level language used in the host to specify programs for execution 
in the satellite. These programs are first compiled into PGP machine language in the host and then transmitted 
to the satellite where they are executed in response to asynchronous interrupts (attentions) originating 
from various types of interactive graphic input devices. In this manner, fairly complex and tailored 
interactions such as multiple line rubberbanding and limited area tracking are specified convenientlyby 
applications programs in the host computer. 1. INTRODUCTION For the past several years, the concept 
of interfac­ ing graphic satellite computers to a large time­ shared host computer has gained popularity. 
The ad­ vantages of such configurationshave been described in a number of other papers [1-5]. The graphic 
 satellite computer, typically a mini-computer, serves to unburden the host computer of trivial but 
 time-consumingsupport work while providing a real­ time response to users interacting with refresh 
graphic display terminals. Resources of the large time-shared host computer can then be concentrated 
 more effectively on providing adequate processing and data base functions for application programs. 
 A number of host/satelliteimplementationshave been described having capabilities that range from relatively 
simple "fixed-function" satellites to very complex programmable satellites. The program­ mable satellitesprovide 
superior facilities by which the applicationprogram running in the host computercan control user interactions 
in the remote satellite environment. Systems of this type, how­ ever, still exhibit their own peculiar 
set of prob­ lems. The "division of labor" problem has often been commented upon and significant research 
in this area has been reported by Hamlin and Foley [6] at U.N.C. and by Van Dam and Stabler [7] at Brown. 
 Both of these efforts have been aimed at achieving a balanced division of processing tasks between (at 
least) two processors. This distributed processing ideal, while an admirable goal for a general purpose 
 host-satelliteconfiguration,is not realized with­out paying a price in operating system size, com­plexity, 
and perhaps run-time efficiency. This price may prove unacceptablein configurationsthat have multiple 
satellites because the per-stationcost of each satellite becomes an important criteria. There is considerable 
economic motivation to base such systems on relatively small satellite processors with slightlymore than 
sufficient power to handle the most demanding application anticipated. For example, the presence of 
rotating memory can in­ crease the overall system cost dramatically when re­ quired on each satellite 
in a system, and therefore becomes undesirable unless the need truly justifies the expense. If one 
views the satellite computers in a multiple satellite configurationas having a special rather than 
general purpose (i.e., each is to serve as a remote displayprocessor or graphic support cpu) then the 
need for a large degree of flexibility in dis­ tributing processing tasks between the two computers 
is minimized. In general, decisions along these lines then become fairly clear. It is desirable to offload 
the main cpu and decrease communicationtraf­fic as much as possible. As much of the graphics work as 
is practicable and reasonable should be done in the graphic support cpu. To this end, the appli­cation 
programmer'sawareness of the dual cpu con­figuration can influence the structure of his de­sign to take 
advantage of the configurationin cer­tain cases (e.g., where parallel processing is pos­sible or where 
"fine tuning" is required). The major problem then becomes one of providing a natural and convenientmeans 
for the application program running in the host to specify and control interaction processing in the 
satellite. A very time consuming aspect of developing interactive graphic applications programs involves 
optimal in­ terfacing of the system with highly-interactiveend users in differing applicationareas. This 
requires that much attention be given to human engineering and results in frequent modification and 
revision of programs. While subroutine packages have tradition­ally provided a means for specifyingpictures, 
not much work has been devoted to providing an adequate and reasonably general means for specifying and 
con­trolling user interactions at a remote graphics station. The Interactive Control Tables described 
by Cotton [8] provide a language facility whereby an application program running in the host processor 
 can specify complex interactionprograms to be exe­cuted in the satellite. With the exception of this 
noteworthy work and that described by Christenson and Pinson [4] and by Kilgour [9, 10], little re­search 
has been done (or at least published) regard­ing improved methods for specifying and accomplish­ ing 
remote user interactions. The state of the art still seems to be at the macro or subroutine level, with 
such packages commonlybeing furnished as inter­ active graphics system software. Packages of this type 
are grossly inadequate from the viewpoint of the application programmer; furthermore, they often do not 
make effective use of system resources. Large host/graphic satellite systems are becoming increasingly 
complex in order to meet specific end­user requirements and to provide for even greater system capabilities 
and throughput. End users are continually imposing additional requirements for complex interaction 
and concurrent retrieval and processing of associated information in diverse forms. As applications become 
more demanding and in­ volved, the need for better application independent programming tools tailored 
for this environment be­comes more acute. Successful implementation of a wide range of varied application 
projects requires a comprehensive and efficient set of development eff tools. To provide an effectiveprogramming 
tool and opera­ tional environment for execution of programs in a highly interactive host/satelliteconfiguration, 
the graphics system software should possess the follow­ing attributes: o A single, complete operating 
environ­ ment extending across both processors. The remote satellite software should provide for efficient 
execution of in­teraction programs through effective management of available resources. The host processor 
software should present a comfortable and natural in­terface to the application programmer. o A graphics-orientedinteraction 
lan­guage facility. Semantics of the lan­guage should be fairly primitive (e.g., like an implementationlanguage) 
to enable custom tailoring of interaction programs to be executed in the satel­lite. The language should 
be powerful in its ability to specify remote in­ teractions, but it should also be easy to learn and 
to use. No attempt will be made here to defend the validity of these contentions. The purpose of this 
paper is to describe how these attributes have been realized in a specific implementation,and in particular 
how various elements of the operating environment and language complement each other. Critical parameters 
that influence performance and must be considered in the design of the system soft­ware include efficient 
use of local satellite memory, response time for end users at a variety of remote graphic stations, 
and the speed with which informa­tion can be accessed and manipulated. In systems that are usually bound 
by operator interaction and access to data bases, these parameters are often considered far more important 
than central process­ ing speed. While this may seem obvious, it is stated explicitly to confirm the 
underlyingphilo­ sophy upon which the design of the system software is based. Effectivemanagementof 
system resources requires numerous tradeoffs of one resource for an­ other in an attempt to achieve 
an optimum balance. Without such a guiding philosophy it is almost im­ possible to correct an imbalance 
once the interior architectureof an operating environment has been designed. 2. BACKGROUND The graphic 
interaction facilities described in this paper are an integral part of a unique host/satel­ lite architecture 
developed at Digital Equipment Corporation and previously described by Bruce [11]. This architecture 
has been derived to fulfill the graphics needs of a large computer-aideddesign system [12]. Briefly, 
this CAD system is based on a network of DECsystem-10'ssupportinga distributed engineering data base 
using a general-purposedata base management system, DBMS-10, in a time-shared environment. Each DECsystem-10 
(host) computer is required to support eight to twelve graphic satel­ lite processors. The variety of 
graphics hardware to be supported by the satellites demands that more than one type of cpu be used 
as a satellite process­ or. Furthermore, many satellite processors are re­quired to support multiple 
(up to four) graphics de­vices concurrently. Plotters and storage tubes are driven via this architecture 
as well as full-function refresh displays. Two environmental considerations that influenced the satellite 
software system design included: 1. The satellites must not require rotat­ing memory for economic reasons. 
 2. Most satellites will be relatively near (less than 3 miles) to the host and can be hardwired using 
high-speed  (100 kb) communication links. The remainder of this paper describes the host/sat­ ellite 
operating environment with particular empha­ sis on the methods used to specify and accomplish graphic-oriented 
interactions. 3. THE SATELLITE ARCHITECTURE The satellite architecture resembles that of a special-purposecomputer 
closely coupled to a power­ful display processor. It is programmed in a man­ner oriented towards graphics, 
and it contains only graphic-orienteddata. Interaction between a user and an application data structure 
is via specific graphic constructs. The resulting machine has been named the Programmable Graphics Processor 
or PGP. Like a general-purposecomputer, the PGP has memory, an interrupt structure, and a control element. 
PGP memory, however, consists of program space and reg­ ister space only (i.e., there is no random access 
 memory). The interrupt structure enables devices attached to the PGP to asynchronouslysignal the processor 
about some external event such as a light pen detection or a keyboard strike. Such interrupts are viewed 
on a logical rather than physical level and are termed "attentions". Attention handler programs residing 
in the PGP program space are exe­cuted as a result of an attention. The control ele­ment provides for 
decoding and execution of PGP in­ structions as well as the sequencing of program logic. The display 
processor portion of the PGP machine accepts and processes a structured picture definition that has 
been sent to the PGP in a common interface format. This portion of the PGP inter­faces to a comprehensive 
set of interactive display­oriented registers that can be accessed directly by attention programs. The 
displayportion of the PGP alone is sufficient for certain passive (i.e., out­put only) graphic devices 
such as plotters. In this case the PGP really is not programmed at all, but merely interprets a picture 
definition and pre­sents the picture on a particular device. The programmabilityof the PGP machine is 
in the area of user interactions. Therefore, the dual na­ture of the PGP machine is resolved by viewing 
it as two processors: a picture processor and an interac­tion processor. The interaction processor communi­cates 
with the picture processor, in the case of in­teractive display devices, via the previouslymen­ tioned 
device registers and a set of graphic chan­nels. Once initialized, graphic channels provide high-speed 
access to both coordinate and parametric information in portions of the picture that are to be manipulatedor 
modified in real time. Although the PGP architecture described above re­ sembles that of a hardwired 
processor, it is cur­rently implemented by emulation in software. It was originally written in the BLISS-11 
implementa­ tion language for the PDP-11 with a GT40 display, and subsequently translated to assembler 
language for the PDP-15 computer driving a VT15 display. The picture processor and interaction processor 
have been implemented as two independent but closely re­lated interpreters. These interpreters are re­entrant 
and draw upon the facilitiesof an under­ lying, stand-alone operating system. The operat­ing system is 
core resident and provides for a sophisticatedlevel of multi-programmingsuch that up to four PGP machines 
can be emulated concurrently on the same satellite processor. A keyboard device can be associatedwith 
each of the logical PGP ma­chines, and each keyboard can operate either as an interactive PGP device 
or as an independent time­sharing terminal connected to the host computer. 3.1 The Picture Processor 
 The picture processor is implemented in the form of a Pseudo Display File Interpreter. The PGP builds 
structuredpictures from data and transformations supplied by host computer applicationprograms in the 
form of a pseudo display file (PDF). The PDF is a device independent representationof the picture and 
includes window boundary, view center or view­port, and scaling information such that any portion of 
a picture can be presented at any desired size or location. The PDF is segmented [13] and is built from 
calls to a set of graphic subroutines in the host computer. When received by the PGP, the PDF is interpreted, 
transformed, and clipped to generate an actual display file or sequence of drawing com­mands. For interactive 
devices, the logical struc­ture of the picture is maintained in an ordered seg­ment table which provides 
access to addressable con­trol points (segments)within the real display file. As implied, segments constitute 
the basic picture building elements. The applicationprogram assigns segment names (numbers) when building 
a picture and can form an arbitrarilycomplex hierarchical tree structure if desired. The only reason 
for including a structure with the picture is to provide a means for dynamic identificationand modificationof 
dis­crete portions of the picture. Segments are actu­ally nodes of a tree and, hence, follow a tree dis­ 
 cipline (i.e., each segment has only one heritage). The picture can be manipulated or modified at any 
level in the hierarchy as required by the applica­tion. Segment names need not be unique since a given 
 node in the tree is identified by a path (list of segment names) through the tree. There are two types 
of segments: structural and primitive. Structural segments correspond to the in­ternal nodes of a tree, 
and primitive segments corre­spond to endnodes or leaves. Structural segments serve only to logically 
group a set of other seg­ments which, in turn, may be either structural or primitive. Primitive segments 
describe the visible portion of a picture (i.e., lines, text, circles, etc.). A primitive segment is 
defined as a type­dependent algorithm that operates on a supplied set of data points. For example, a 
line segment consists of a set of points that are to be connected by straight lines, and a circle segment 
consists of a set of points specifying where each instance of a defined circle is to appear. It is possible 
to build a picture with only primitive segments. In fact, this might well be the case for passive graphic 
devices where dynamic interaction is not required. Segment parameters including reference point, scale, 
rotation, and mirroring can be specified for each segment whether structuralor primitive. The refer­ence 
point of a segment is distinct from the data points of a primitive. It is essentially an offset from 
the next higher-level segment,and defines a lo­cal origin for all coordinateswithin the segment with 
which it is associated. Thus, the position of a group of primitives having a common ancestor can be altered 
by changing only the ancestor's reference point. Graphic parameters (including intensity,line texture, 
blink, etc.) can be associated with a struc­tural segment, a primitive segment, or data points within 
a primitive segment. These parameters apply to the entire heritage of a node unless redefined at a lower 
level in a sub-tree beginning at that node. At the lowest level, graphic parameters related to a point 
in a primitive segment affect only the graphics associated with that specific point.  3.2 The Interaction 
Processor Man-machine communicationusing interactivegraphics is made possible by using a human operator 
to "close the loop" between a displayed picture and various in­ put devices associated with the display 
medium. In the PGP, control of operator interaction with such devices is accomplished by means of (PGP)machine­level 
programs that are executed upon the asynchron­ ous occurrence of attentions (logical interrupts) from 
these devices. Each interaction device poten­tially has a corresponding attention handling pro­gram. 
Drawing on a very rich instruction set, these programs can read and change the contents of various registers 
in the Interaction Processor, make compari­sons and alter program flow, and perform a broad repertoire 
of arithmetic, logical, and string  operations. The programs also are capable of provid­ ing control 
functions such as dynamically enabling or disabling attention sources, invoking subroutines, initiating 
transmissionof information to the host computer, and terminating program execution. PGP attention programsmonitor 
and control graphic in­put devices by reading and writing a comprehensive set of interactivedevice registers. 
They also can manipulate portions of the displayed picture by modi­ fying or deleting specific graphic 
constructs and by adding, modifying, or deleting coordinate points or graphic parameters in a primitive. 
In this way, PGP attention programs couple graphic input devices (and hence the user) with the picture. 
 Attention sources that are currently defined for the PGP machine are summarizedbelow. Not all of these 
 attention sources, however, are based on manual in­ teraction. Host computerandinterval timer atten­ 
tions signal asynchronous events that may occur completely independent of operator actions.  Even though 
there may be separate attention pro­grams for each possible attention source, all of the facilities 
of the interaction processor (i.e., registers, etc.) may be used by any attention pro­gram. In general, 
the PGP machine code in which attentionprograms are defined consists of a set of instructions directedtowards 
the PGP register set and graphic channels. The PGP register set includes the processor registers and 
graphic device interac­ tion registers summarizedbelow.  PGP processor registers include eight general 
regis­ ters, four text string accumulators, a general­purpose pushdown stack, and an Interval Timer reg­ 
ister. Any general register can be loaded with data from other general registers, the device reg­ isters, 
or with immediate data from attention pro­ grams. These registers can then be manipulated arithmeticallyor 
logicallyand can be compared with other registers or immediate data for condi­ tional branching. The 
general text string accumu­ lators can be loaded with immediate text strings from attention programs, 
displayed text strings, or text strings from other string accumulators. They can be employed to perform 
conversions of decimal character strings into binary values in general reg­ isters (or vice versa), 
to compare text strings, to accomplish text string concatenations,and to form messages that are to be 
displayed locally or returned to the host computer. The general purpose stack and related PGP instructions 
provide for pushing and popping of word data, allocation or deallocation of stack space, and indexed 
access to entries on the stack. In addition, the entire latest light pen de­tected segment hierarchy 
can be loaded onto the stack with a single instruction,and subsequently used to open a graphic channel 
or for other purposes. The Interval Timer register may be loaded with a value that representsa period 
of time in increments of 1/60 of a second. When this period of time has ex­pired, the Interval Timer 
attention is generated and the associated attention program is executed. All interactivedevices interface 
to the PGP by means of device registers. The loading of an input device register results from a physical 
interrupt and usu­ally generates a logical attention for the PGP. The appropriate attention program is 
then executed which, in turn, can interrogate the device register(s). The attention program may manipulate 
this device-related data, if required, and use it to control program flow, to modify displayed graphics, 
to return infor­mation to the host processor, or to provide many other control functions. Output devices 
other than the actual display device are interfaced to the PGP. These include lights, printing or other 
message de­vices, and the pseudo-devicetracking symbol. The PGP controlsthese devices by means of associated 
device registers. Loading these registers produces an appropriate action in the output device as a side 
effect. For example, loading coordinate data into the tracking symbol position register(s) causes the 
tracking symbol to appear at that point on the dis­play device. Positioning device delta registers hold 
the incremental distances by which the position­ ing device was last moved. Data in these registers 
is not cumulative, but rather set to new values on each movement of the device. The delta registers 
 can be used to update the position of graphic con­ structs that are "attached" to a tracking device 
and are to be moved when the tracking device is moved. In addition to processor and device registers,the 
 PGP architecture includes several read-only regis­ ters that indicate specific device characteristics. 
 These registers are included because the PGP is ca­ pable of supportinga wide variety of graphic devices. 
 The device characteristics registers may be trans­ mitted to the host computerto allow the application 
 program to make intelligent decisions regarding the capabilities of the particular PGP with which it 
is associated. The interaction processor includes a large set of (64) graphic channels that are defined 
to allow di­ rect access to a specific portion of the displayed picture that typically is to be modified 
by real­time operator interaction. Channels are addressed by number and are opened by specifying a list 
of segment names (i.e., a path through the hierarchy) that uniquely identifies the segment that is to 
be accessed. Once opened, a channel may be positioned sequentiallyto any subsegment within a structural 
segment or to any point within a primitive segment. Associated coordinate and parametric information 
can then be read, inserted, or changed very rapidly un­ der attention program control. Instructions 
are specificallyprovided in the PGP to accomplish channel-orientedoperations dynamic­ally and locally 
without host processor interven­tion. Perhaps one of the most significant of these is an instruction 
to open a channel with a segment hierarchy supplied on the pushdown stack. This hier­archy may have resulted 
from a light pen detection or practically any other application-sensiblemeans. Also, instructions are 
provided to add positioning device delta registers to either or both coordinates on an opened channel. 
This operation causes a dis­ played entity to appear to move in unison with the positioning device. 
The real power of this facil­ ity, however, is realized in an instruction that applies this operation 
to all open channels. Com­plex interactions involving simultaneous rubber­banding of numerous lines can 
thus be simply speci­ fied and efficiently accomplished. Channel-oriented instructionsare also provided 
to close a channel (or all channels), to delete a subsegment (or point in a primitive) to which a channel 
is positioned, and to read, insert, or modify a specific coordi­ nate or parameter via an open channel. 
Channeldata that is accessible to attention programs is summar­ized below.  The concept of graphic channels 
is one of the key elements in the design of the PGP architecture. High-speed access to portions of the 
displayed pic­ture that are to be modified in real time is an ab­solute necessity. The degree to which 
this facility is highly programmable is also quite important. The graphic channels as implemented have 
far ex­ceeded the minimum performance goals originally es­tablished. Very complex manual interactions 
re­lated to multi-layer printed circuit board design are accomplished with ease and entirely within the 
satellite. 4. THE INTERACTION LANGUAGE The interactionprocessor in the PGP is supported by an interaction 
program compiler in the host com­puter. The interaction language is designed to pro­ vide the applicationprogrammer 
access to all of the programmable facilities of the PGP machine. High-level constructs are provided 
within the frame­work of a block-structured implementationlanguage for specifying interaction tasks. 
An interaction task consists of a set of attention handlers that are precompiled and referred to by 
a common task name. The applicationprogram invokes named inter­action tasks by calling a small run-time 
support package that simply supplies any specified run-time parameters and then transmits the generated 
PGP machine-levelcode to the satellite. Each of the attention handlers that comprise an interaction 
task consists of an ordered set of interaction language statements. An ON statement indicates the particu­lar 
attention source with which a given attention handler is to be associated. Subsequent program statements 
are enclosed in BEGIN-END pairs or paren­ theses, which are completely interchangeable. For example, 
the general form used to specify an atten­tion handler to be executed upon occurrence of a light pen 
detection is as follows:  Each of the interaction language statementsthat form the body of an attention 
handler is terminated with a semicolon. These statements may be one of several types that include assignment 
statements, program control statements, and various directives.  4.1 Assignment Statements An assignment 
statement consists of any writeable identifier followed by an equal sign, which is fol­lowed by a general 
expression. A writeable identi­fier is the symbology for expressing either a write­able PGP register 
or a graphic parameter associated with an active channel. The language makes no pro­vision for user-defined 
variables since there is no random access memory in the PGP. However, PGP reg­isters as well as graphic 
parameters are referenced symbolicallyby means of keyword mnemonics that have been defined above. For 
example, TSX is the identi­fier for the tracking symbol X register, and GO is the identifier for general 
register 0. Graphic parameters associated with an active channel are referenced by preceding a channel 
designator with an appropriate mnemonic. Thus I[3] refers to the intensity parameter associated with 
the graphic en­tity on channel 3. The generalexpressionsused in assignment statements are formed by 
combining readable identifiers with available operators. Readable identifiers include designators for 
registers that can be read, numeric constants, string literals, and run-time arguments. Thus, the assignment 
statement GO=LPX+100; adds the decimal constant 100 to the value of the latest light pen detected X 
coordinate and places the result in general register 0. String literals are expressed as a string of 
characters enclosed within quotation marks. Thus, the assignment state­ ment S[3]="HELLO"; changes 
the displayed text string on channel 3 to the characters HELLO. Both constants and string literals 
can also be passed as run-time arguments. Run-time arguments are referenced positionally with the notation 
$n, where n is associatedwith the se­quential position of the referenced argument. This facility to pass 
run-time arguments allows standard interaction programs to be written and subsequently  tailored for 
a particular use at applicationpro­gram execution time. Mixed mode (i.e., both numeric and string) opera­tions 
are explicitly permitted in general expres­sions, and the compiler generates the PGP code to perform 
appropriate conversions where required. The destinationregister ultimately determines the mode of any 
expression in an assignment statement. Thus, the statements  specified in a tracking symbol attention 
program would display a continuous numeric indication of the tracking symbol position providing channels 
1 and 2 were opened to text primitive segments. Note that this operation implies a conversion from 
the binary values held in the tracking symbol registers to two corresponding character strings. General 
expressions are parsed from left to right without operator precedence and without parentheses to force 
precedence. The following operators may be used in forming general expressions: + Addition (or unary 
minus) * Multiplication / Division :Text string concatenation &#38; Logical AND ! Inclusive OR Logical 
NOT (unary)  4.2 Control Statements Interaction program control statements, which di­ rect program 
flow, fall into one of the categories listed below. Each of these constructs is dis­ cussed in the following 
paragraphs. compares the X coordinate value of the latest light pen detection with the value resulting 
from multiply­ing the contents of general register 0 by the con­stant 10. Multiple relational expressions 
separated by Boolean AND and OR connectors may be specified in a single conditional expression. For example, 
the above relational expression could be expanded to  to express a more complex Boolean condition. 
This conditional expression, in turn, could be included with an IF/THEN statement such as  to conditionallyposition 
the tracking symbol within a variable-sizedarea in the lower right hand corner of the display. Program 
looping constructs are made available in the interaction language in the following general forms.  The 
only difference between the two constructs is the point where the conditional test is made. Also, WHILE 
specifies execution of the action clause as long as the condition is TRUE, and UNTIL specifies execution 
of the action clause as long as the condi­tion is FALSE. The CASE statement provides a structured multiple 
branch with only one entry point and one exit. This construct has the following general form.  IF/THEN/ELSE 
statements have the following general forms:  The action clause following a THEN or an ELSE can consist 
of one or more program statements of any type enclosed in a BEGIN-END pair or parentheses. In fact, additional 
IF/THEN/ELSE statements may be specified within an action clause to effect nest­ ing of program control 
logic. Conditional expressions are comprised of one or more relational expressions, which are formed 
by separa­ting two general expressions with a relational op­erator. Relational operators include the 
usual GTR, LSS, EQL, GEQ, LEQ, and NEQ. For example, the relational expression   The CASE statement 
specifies the execution of one of the action clauses that follow the keyword SET. The value of the readable 
identifier provides an index to determine which action clause is to be executed. Routines are invoked 
from attention handlers or other routines via the general construct CALL n  where n identifies the 
routine that is to be exe­cuted. Terminationof execution within a routine is simply specified by RETURN. 
 4.3 Directives The interaction language includes directives that provide certain control functions,perform 
limited picture modifications,and return information to the host computer. These include both channel-oriented 
 and non-channel oriented directives. Channel­orienteddirectives provide for program control of PGP graphic 
channels and include OPEN, POSITION, CLOSE, LOCK, and UNLOCK. The OPEN and POSITION di­rectives are provided 
to establish a channel to point to a portion of the picture that is to be read or modified in real time. 
These directives have the following general form:  Opening a channel establishes a link to a particu­ 
lar segment with the designated heritage. Having opened a channel, POSITION can be used to orient the 
 channel to a particular sub-element of the segment to which the channel has been opened. If the chan­ 
nel has been opened to a structural segment, it may be positioned to a subsegment; if the channel has 
 been opened to a primitive segment, it may be posi­ tioned to a specific point within that primitive. 
 When achannel link is no longer needed, it may be broken by means of the CLOSE directive. LOCK and 
 UNLOCK directives are included to provide control in exempting specified channels from certain all­ 
channel operations. Non-channel oriented directives include SEND, BLANK, UNBLANK, ENABLE, and DISABLE. 
The SEND directive returns information specified by an argument list to the host computer along with 
an indication of the type of information being sent. The BLANK and UNBLANK directives are followed by 
a segment list to indicate a picture segment that is to be made to appear or disappear from view. The 
ENABLE and DISABLE directives provide for program control over attention sources. In additionto the 
directives mentioned above, a DELETE directive is also included. This directive may be either channel-orientedor 
non-channel oriented depending on which of the following gen­ eral forms is used.   4.4 Example A 
special syntax is included in the interaction language to enable an applicationprogrammer to specify 
an operation that is to be performed on all open channels. To illustrate, the assignment state­ment 
 specifies changing the intensityof graphic en­tities on all open channels to intensity level 4. Similarly,the 
construct  specifies adding the values of the tracking symbol delta registers to the coordinate values 
on each open channel. This particular assignment statement can be employed to accomplish multiple line 
rubber­banding. In fact, assuming that appropriate chan­nel control has been established and that tracking 
 210 symbol attentions have been enabled, the attention handler  provides for multiple line rubberbandingwhile 
con­ straining tracking symbol movement to some portion of the left hand side of the screen which has 
been de­ fined at applicationprogram run-time. This example as well as others in this section is in­ 
tended to illustrated specific features and capabili­ ties of the interaction language. In the interest 
 of brevity,many language features have not been de­ scribed. Although the material presented is neces­ 
sarily brief, it is hoped that it still conveys the "flavor" of the language as well as the naturalness 
 and ease with which more complex interaction tasks might be specified. 5. CONCLUSION The PGP architectureand 
interaction language de­ scribed herein are a unique combination of general concepts that togetherprovide 
a powerful, device independent operating environment. The PGP archi­ tecture provides for efficient 
execution of interac­ tion programs in the highly interactive satellite environment. Simultaneousrubberbanding 
of 25 separ­ ate lines is routinely handled with little speed degradation. The authors feel that emulation 
of the PGP architecture in software makes very efficient use of core memory. Complex interaction tasks 
can often be specified in only a few words, with the re­ sponsibility for carrying out such tasks being 
dele­ gated to the system software. The overhead of in­ terpretationhas not proven to be a limiting factor 
 at any time. The satellite system software current­ ly resides in 12-14K words of 16-or 18-bit memory 
 and uses an additional8-12K words for display file and tables. Practical experience with the interac­ 
tion language has shown it to be natural and easy to learn, while enabling a high degree of custom tailor­ing 
in specifying remotely executed interaction pro­grams. The language encourages the application pro­grammer 
to think of interaction requirements algo­rithmically. The fact that the applicationprogram­mer must 
be bilingual has not proven to be a problem, possibly because the language resembles the BLISS implementationlanguage 
used for the CAD applica­tions. The decisionto implement a special purpose language was made only after 
considering alternatives that included a subroutine package, a set of high­level macros, and extensions 
to the host implementa­tion language. Each of these alternatives was found lacking. On the application 
level, since the language is in­dependent of actual hardware subtleties and machine­level code, interaction 
tasks are easy to modify and maintain. Applications have been developed on one processor while intended 
to run on a completely dif­ ferent type of processor. On the system level, new instructionsand facilities 
have been added to the PGP architectureand subsequently reflected in the language with relative ease. 
Continuing work is be­ing done, however, to enhance both the language and the satellite architecture.

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania AFFORDABILITYOF COMPUTER GRAPHICS FOR PLANNING NETWORKS IN 
DOD PROGRAM MANAGEMENT J. Potoczniak, M. Kosmin, R. Larkin LCDR J. Callahan, R. M. Dunn ABSTRACT This 
report represents data relative to the alternative consideration involved in selecting a configurationfor 
the Interactive Graphics Net­ working System, (IGNS). The IGNS permits a user to interactivelyview a 
network, modify it, if needed, analyze various management options and view their impact upon the data 
contained in the network, and, finally receive network plots and management reports. A prototype of 
this system was developed and tested for feasibility. Having proven the feasibility, the purpose of this 
report is to provide the data necessary for a user to decide the individual optimum system configurationwhich 
may be used to facilitate an interactive net­working reporting capability. INTRODUCTION This paper 
examines the affordability of implementing graphic links between a network display and a planning model 
in DOD program offices. The computer assisted capabilities include: update, change, and edit features 
 which permit easier maintenance of plans; a variety of display formats for assistance in the analysis 
of plans; a convenientmethod of investigating planningalternatives; and hard­ copy output options to 
facilitate the distribu­ tion of plans. Alternative configurations of hardware, software, data bases 
and organiza­ tional support are examined. An economic analy­ sis is conducted of these combinations 
to pro­ vide the basis for determiningaffordability. The purpose of the graphic links is to assist 
the management of weapons system acquisition by improving the planning and control capabi­ lity of program 
management offices through applied computer technology. By laying out the network of jobs to be done, 
the project manager can obtain an explicit visual repre­ sentation of the relationships among the tasks 
 involved. It would also permit the convenient simulation and evaluation of management options. Such 
a link can be established through the appli­ cation of computer graphics. Graphic links between a network 
display and a planning model require that the capability can be provided in a form useful to practicingprogram 
offices and in a manner affordable by the majority of DOD programs. HARDWARE/SOFTWARECONSIDERATIONS 
 The Interactive Graphics NetworkingSystem is capable of operating on many different hard­ ware configurations. 
Four basic system configura­ tions are presented from which extrapolation or modificationwill permit 
examination of other basic systems. The hardware, as shown in Figure 1, for the four configurationsare: 
 A. Remote mainframe with a local terminal B. Remote mainframe with a local minicomputer and terminal 
 C. Local minicomputerand terminal with a remote mainframe D. Local minicomputersystem with terminal 
 Each of the configurationswhich involve the us­age of a mainframe, share some similar operating characteristics. 
Some of these characteristics are: a. Deliverytime may be several hours to about two days.  b. Costs 
will be incurredwhich are directly dependent upon usage.  c. Data storage costs will be incurred.  
d. High level confidentialitymay not be fully achieved.  e. User has a schedule priority on the mainframe 
queue.  f. The user does not require special facilities to house equipment, etc.  ConfigurationA is 
the simplest hardware configu­ration, from the user's point of view. The user requires the least amount 
of local equipment with no highly skilled computer specialists required for operation. The user would 
interface with the mainframe via a graphics terminal and receive output from the mainframe (i.e. plots 
and reports) The necessary software located in the mainframe (Fig. 1) is comprised of algorithmic network 
functions, operating systems, graphics support, network plotting procedures, report generators, and data 
maintenance procedures. Configuration B is slightlymore complex than A. It has some additional equipment 
and allows the user a storage capabilityand off-line mode of operation. The user may extract some fundamental 
information from the mainframe, manipulate it, store it, and then later send back to the main­frame for 
a network plot or report. No highly trained personnel are required to operate this system, but the user 
will need some computer hardware and software background. This configuration has the networking software, 
 (Fig 1), housed on the mainframe which performs all of the major computational operations. The minicomputer 
housed in the user's facilities per­ forms low level computations and graphics support functions. The 
mainframe acts as the input and data processor, however, the user may store basic network data in his 
own facilities as well as on the mainframe. Configuration C utilizes the minicomputer as an intelligent 
satellite. It uses the mainframe for massive computation and storage as needed. Its operation entails 
using two people with a computer background to provide software and data base integrity. The mainframe 
would perform only initial calculationswhile all other operations (Plotting, Printing, Storing Data, 
etc.) would be performed at the user's facilities. The option to use the mainframe, however, for many 
user requests is still available. The configuration places most of the software for the IGNS System in 
the local minicomputerand its peripherals. The mainframe houses the management reporting functions and 
transforms initial data into the form acceptable to the IGNS System. In this case the mainframe acts 
only as a "front end" to the minicomputer and its peripherals. ConfigurationD requires the most user 
hardware and two operating personnel in addition to the configuration users. All operations would be 
per­formed at the user's facilities. Plotting, re­porting, data storage,modifications, etc., would all 
be implemented at the Project Manager's loca­tion. Itis a completely user housed/userdedicated system. 
It incorporates the necessary software and provides for the hardware needed to satisfy all networking 
and reporting requirements. It can be assumed that the configurations described are functionallyequivalent 
and that the hardware and software ascribed to each con­figuration fulfills only the minimum requirements 
for functional equivalence. (See Figure 1) ADVANTAGES OF AN INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS NETWORKING SYSTEM 
 The most notable differences between a fully interactive networking system and a mainframe based networkingsystem 
are: a. Changes to the network and data may be made quickly and repetitively.  b. Modified reports 
and network plots may be obtained in hours, or at worst, one or two days, on a fully operational sys­tem. 
 c. The user may directlyview his network on a graphics screen, select his level of detail for viewing, 
and if desired, modify his data and obtain a report or network plot.  The resultingmanagement improvements 
would be: faster planning, higher qualityplans and a com­ prehensive capability useful throughout all 
stages of the program life. This improved capability would be particularlyresponsive to the dynamic 
 needs of a project manager. The user has several options which may be select­ed from a graphic menu 
by the use of an electro­nic pointer in order to: (a) change a network view, (b) change a data base item, 
(c) produce a hardcopy. In option (a),change a network view, the user may select several different ways 
of viewing a net­work. These are: (1) slack view, (2) centered view, (3) top down view, (4) time phase 
view, (5) Gantt chart view. In option (b),changea data base item, the user may: (1) change an event 
or activity descrip­tion, (2) add an event or activity,(3) delete an event or activity. In option(cb 
produce a hardcopy, the user may: (1) obtain a network showing an overall view with no detail, (2) obtain 
a network showing a detailed view will all data shown, (3) obtain a management report tailored specially 
to his requirements. CRITERIA USED TO EVALUATE SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS The following major criteriawere 
used in the evaluation: a. Cost -to acquire, implement, operate, and maintain both the hardware and 
soft­ware.  b. Capacity -the number of networks and reports the configurationcan throughput per unit 
time.  c. Turnaround time -the time required to obtain a network plot, management report, or fulfill 
a requirement using the con­figuration.  d. Privacy -provide user protection from unauthorized access 
to data.  e. Integrity -the data base is reliable from a data handling and operational point of view. 
  The overall criteriaused in the quantitative analysis of the configuration is whether or not a faster, 
more comprehensive and detailed means of project control would be realized by the user. EVALUATINGALTERNATIVECONFIGURATIONS 
 Assessment A user, in selecting a particular configuration, must map his inventory of, or accessabilityto, 
 computer hardware. This assessment will serve as the foundation upon which a configurationmay be established. 
For example, the availabilityof a mainframe (ex. IBM 360, CD6600, or equivalent) may serve as a beginning 
for configurationA, which requires only a mainframe, networking and related software, and a graphics 
console, or it may serve as the basis for configurationB or C. Once the user has completed his assessment 
of the hardware that he has available to him, he may then determine which type of a configurationwould 
most appropriatelysuit his needs. Sharing One Configuration If one configurationwere shared by a multi-user 
 group, then trade-offs must be considered. For example; if any of the configurationsare shared, then 
the acquisition costs, implementation,and maintenancecosts are evenly divided among the users, and, operating 
costs are defrayed to the extent personnel cost are evenly divided. Some costs are not diminished by 
sharing a configura­tion. The cost of supplies, for example, remains the same since this cost is dependent 
upon the quantity of usage per user, not on the number of users. Computer usage costs (i.e. for configura­tion 
A, B, or C) also remains the same since each user will bear this cost independent of the other users. 
Sharing also involves a loss of conven­ience and timeliness as a result of possibly having to enter a 
queue (if one exists), and wait for use of the configuration. Upgrading Characteristics If a user 
were not satisfied with a particular characteristic of a configuration,he should consider the cost of 
upgrading that characteris­tic before arriving at any final decisions regard­ing that configuration. 
 a. Turnaround Time: For example; a one to two day (i.e. the baseline is one day) turnaround time may 
be inadequate for some purposes and the cost of upgrading this characteristic may be the cost of having(a) 
courier or other person partially dedicated to this task. b. Capacity: If the number of reports and/or 
network plots a configurationcould output in one day were not sufficient, (i.e. the baseline is five 
per day) to meet the user's requirements, the cost of upgrading this characteristic (i.e. the cost of 
a second plotter or faster disk, etc.) should be added to the configuration cost (if any). c. Response 
Time: The baseline response time is ten seconds. That is, the time for a user to transmit, complete, 
and receive a response to an action which he has intiated, (i.e. this does not include changes to net­work 
logic which requires five minutes). If a faster response time is desired, then possibly a faster baud 
rate may be purcha­sed or a higher priority be bought or fas­ter I/O devices purchased. These costs should 
be added to the configuration cost. Thus, the cost of upgrading any configura­tion characteristic should 
be considered as part of the total configurationcost. In addition, a user should evaluate the potential 
cost of other quantitative and qualitative effects of sharingconfiguration d. Network Size and Update 
Rate: The base­ line network size used in this report is 100 events, 200 activities; and, the assumed 
update rate for one network is once per month. e. Amount of Networks Per User: The number of assumed 
networks per user is 100. DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED A majority of the data collected involved informa­ 
tion categorized as hardware data, software data, or personnel data. Some of this data was conver­ tible 
to cost information found in subsequent tables. Table 1 summarizes the recurring costs of each of the 
four configurations,which include; personnel, usage, maintenance, and supply costs; the minimum software 
cost required for initial implementationof the configurationwhich may be subject to increases if other 
than basic system requirements are specified by the user; and the basic hardware costs to initiate 
a particularcon­ figuration which is also subject to user options and may increase. Table 2 summarizes 
four basic categories of cost data as they appear over a typical eight year pro­ject management cycle 
and a normalized cost. These categories are; acquisition of a configura­tion, implementation,operation, 
and maintenance. The data was generated by varying a particular parameter to examine its effect upon 
the basic costs shown. A common baseline cost figure for one application by one user for comparison 
on an annual basis was used. The project manager range was derived by dividing the single user cost 
by 3%1 Thus, the (first cost )in Table 2 is divided by 3% to obtain the project manager range. The 
project manager affordabilityof a system is termed "Project ManagerRange ($K)". It is the suggested lower 
bound, not an absolute innegotia­ble value of a dollar range for which a project manager may justify 
a configuration. In addition to this suggested lower bound, qualitative consi­derations must also be 
made which may weigh as heavily as the quantitative data. Some of the qualitative considerations are 
listed in the sec­tion "Criteria Used to Evaluate System Configura­tion". Others may involve the considerations 
 involved in sharing a configuration as opposed to owning one on an exclusive basis. Data In Tables 
 The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 are provided for use in evaluating each of the configurations. 
 Table 1 presents the anticipated costs of acquisi­ tion and usage for each configuration. This cost 
 data is fundamental to any decision a user makes. For example, the cost of an operator (part of re­ 
curring costs) need not necessarily be the cost of a person solely dedicated to using the confi­ guration. 
It may be a fraction of some employee's salary who, in addition to operating the configu­ ration, has 
other assigned duties as well. In configuration D, the cost of personnel is for dedicated personnel. 
The complexity of configura­ tion D demands full time dedicated personnel to maintain and operate it. 
In each case, the user must be aware that personnel costs will be asso­ ciated with each configuration 
and dedicated personnel may be needed and considered as part of the configuration cost. Table 2 compares, 
for each configuration,the cost effect of varying the number of applications (i.e. networkingplotting, 
management reporting, financial reporting, etc.), and the number of users from one user to eight. This 
table demons­ trates that eight users, employing eight indepen­ dent configurationsof the same type (A, 
B, C, or D), decrease the per user cost as compared to one user. Care should be taken to note that 
some costs proportionallyremain the same with an in­ crease in the number of users while others propor­ 
tionally decrease. For example, the implementa­ tion costs for one user increases for eight users, but 
not by a factor of eight as might be expected. The implementation cost for one application in­creases 
for eight applications, but again not by a factor of eight. The reader is cautioned here against assuming 
a direct proportionalityof cost to the number of users. Appendix A is provided to demonstrate the relationships 
which bear upon the costs given here. The reader should be aware of these relationships. SUMMARY Four 
configurations are examined in this paper. The first, called configurationA, is a mainframe computer 
with a graphics terminal attached via a communications line. The next two, called con­figuration B and 
C respectively are mainframe a computer connected to a small minicomputerbased graphics system and a 
mainframe connected to a medium size minicomputerbased system. Finally, configuration D, the fourth, 
is a dedicated large minicomputerbased system. All the data presented is based upon these four configurationsand 
the people, supplies, and hardware/softwareneeded to acquire, implement, operate, and maintain each. 
No conclusions or recommendationsare offered in this paper. The selection of a final configurationmust 
be tail­ ored to the user's requirements. This paper provides a structure for determining costs and affordability. 
The basis for examining the necessaryqualitative considerationsis also 216 provided. It is hoped that 
any bias toward one configurationor another is ommitted and that any judgements derived from this paper 
are the re­ sults of conclusions based solely upon the data contained therein. The cost data presented 
in the tables represent the upper bounds of costs. Economics may result with the sharing of resources. 
 For example, savings can result by eight users operating as a group on eight identical configura­ tions. 
Still further savings will result by a multi-user sharing one configuration. This sharing of costs 
would reduce the per user cost consider­ ably. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Archibald and Villoria, "Network-Based

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania AUTOMATED CONTOURING OF VERTICAL OCEANOGRAPHIC SECTIONS USING 
AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS A. HERMAN National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlantic Oceanographic 
and MeteorologicalLaboratories 15 Rickenbacker Causeway Miami, Florida This paper describes a group 
of computer programs developed for contouring vertical sections of oceanographicparameters. The vertical 
profiles can be constructed from data collected in a variety of ways. The input data for the driver 
subroutine need not be equally spaced horizontally or vertically. The routines are written in Fortran 
for a UNIVAC 1108 with an offline Gould Plotter, but can easily be adapted to any computer with a Fortran 
compiler and a plotter which accepts Calcomp-like commands. The routines are of modular construction. 
 1. INTRODUCTION This paper describes an automated tech­ nique for producing vertical profiles of oceanographic 
data using quasi-objective analysis. The computer program based on the method is also described. Though 
obj ective analysis is well established in meteorology, it has seldom been used in oceanography, and 
when used, it has been restricted to a specific geographical area [Bretherton (2)]. This program is 
not restricted to a specific geographical area and is currently being used by oceano­ graphers at the 
Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Adminis­ tration (NOAA) for studying profiles and creating contour maps in the Gulf of Mexico and the 
New York Bight areas. The advantages of this technique over others generally available to oceanographers 
are: 1. The sampling points for the input data need not be uniformly spaced in either the vertical or 
the horizontal direction.  2. Contours are not extrapolated beyond the input data.  3. Interpolation 
of data is done using statistically based correlation coeffi­cients.  The program is based on the assumptions 
that all stations in a single profile lie close enough to a straight line connecting the two farthest 
stations that no signi­ficant errors will be introduced by assuming all stations to be on that line, 
 and that time differences in the collec­tion of data points may be ignored. These assumptions are needed 
when data do not exist for accurate spatial and time corrections. When studies are made with adequate 
resolution in time and space to make such corrections the program can be modified to include them. 
 2. PROGRAM FLOW PLAN The driver subroutine Versex, calls many subroutines which together accomplish 
the following: 1. The conversion of latitude and longi­tude to rectangular coordinates on a Mercator 
projection. 2. The projection perpendicularly of all stations onto a line connecting the end stations, 
and the computation of the distance of each station from an end of the line. The distances are in inches 
at a scale of four inches equal to one degree of longitude (Figures 1 and 3). 3. The determination 
of the depth scaling is such that the deepest depth is equiva­ lent to the distance between the farthest 
stations. This will produce a square chart with a fixed horizontal scale and the ver­tical scale being 
a function of depth and horizontal size. 4. The fitting of data to a matrix with user controlled smoothing 
with matrix values below deepest depths being logged.  5. The construction of a contour matrix  such 
that a chart is left blank below deepest data, all data points are marked, and the vertical scale is 
labeled (Figures 2 and 4).  . . . . . . \ -. I . n . . . . . . \ l . / b . . . . . . . + + + +

4. Temperature ('C) contour output based on Gulf of Mexico Data. 3. CONVERSION OF LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE 
TO CARTESIAN COORDINATES Subroutine Merc converts latitude and longi­ tude to cartesian coordinates 
on a Mercator projection chart at a scale of four inches equal to one degree of longitude. The chart 
has its origin at ° S and the Greenwich meridian. Chart values increase to the east and the north. Formulae 
for the Mer­ cator projection can be found in Bomford(l).  4. CREATING THE DATA MATRIX The interpolationof 
data onto a grid is normally subjective. Thus the quality of the result depends on the skill of the analyst. 
In order to obtain a more uni­form quality, subroutine WTMAT performs the interpolation in a quasi-objective 
manner. First an array of correlation functions is established,andthen the interpolation is done based 
on the correla­tion function. The method of objective analysis is described in Gandin (3). The equations 
are of the following form: The autocorrelationfunction for the field f(r) is:  where r and r are 
two points in the vertical plane of interest. Instead of using f, it is convenient to use f'=f-T,  the 
statistical deviation from the norm.  Because of assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy [Gandin (3)], 
the correlation function is expressed in terms of separa­ tion distance.  Both noisy data and wave data 
will have a correlation function which crosses zero more than once. To reduce the effects of noise, the 
correlation function, Mf, is taken to be zero past the first zero crossing. The effect of the presence 
of waves on the data will not be smoothed out if the interpolation grid is fine enough (grid size is 
a user option in VERSEX). The correlation coefficient is a normal­ized correlation function:  U '(p) 
represents a correlation coefficient between the values of f' at two points apart and is a function of 
distance. A bar denotes an average and an arrow a vector. The interpolation is done using the follow­ing 
equation:  where f0= deviation of value from known .position. values at known distances r.. n = number 
of observation points. The actual contouring is done on a Gould electrostaticplotter using a Fortran 
pro­gram with Calcomp type plot instructions. The contouring algorithm involves only linear interpolation 
between grid points. This method was chosen for simplicity. 6. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF SUBROUTINE VERSEX 
 VERSEX is the only routine that must be called by the user as illustrated in Appendix A. The calling 
statement is as follows: Call VERSEX (N, M, XLAT, XLON, DAT,DEP,CI DTMIN, DTMAX, DPMIN, DPMAX, NROWS) 
where N = number profiles to be input = maximum number of data points in a profile. XLAT = array of 
latitudes in degrees XLON = array of longitudes in degrees DAT = a two-dimensional array (N,M) of data 
values (empty locations should be set to a negative number.) DEP = a two-dimensional array (N,M) of 
depths corresponding to data points. CI = contour interval (if zero or negative,CI is set = maximum data 
value-minimum data values divided by 10). DTMIN = minimum data value to be con­sidered. If it is negative, 
then it is reset to the lowest value in DAT. DTMAX = maximum data value to be consid­ered. If it is 
negative, then it is reset to the largest data value in DAT. DPMIN = minimum depth. If it is nega­tive, 
then it is reset to the least depth value at which there is a data value.  DPMAX = maximum depth. If 
it is nega­tive or zero, then it is reset to the greatest depth at which there is a data value. NROWS 
(if greater than zero) is the num­ber of rows you want in the matrix to be computed if you wish to control 
the amount of smoothing. The fewer the number of rows the greater the smoothing. Minimum smoothing occurs 
when NROWS = M-1. REFERENCES  (1) Bomford, G., "GEODESY", Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971.  (2) Bretherton,

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania "SGP" -A SIMPLE GRAPHICS PACKAGE Richard E. Putnam and Ralph 
L. Carmichael NASA-Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. This paper presents a simple scheme for 
manipulating graphical information. The basic idea is to generate a user-readable, and therefore editable, 
file of device-independentpicture descriptions. This file would typically be created by a set of FORTRAN-callablesubroutines, 
each having a specific function (draw a vector, draw an axis, write text), but could be created in 
more direct ways by a user sufficiently familiar with the file structure. Once such a file has been 
created and perhaps examined and edited, a post­ processor may be selected to translate the file into 
the device-dependent instructions necessary to produce a picture on a specific device. If the file is 
saved, a different postprocessor could obviously be used later to generate the same picture on another 
device. 1. BACKGROUND The impetus for this work came from user dissatis­ faction with an existing large 
graphics package that attempted to provide interactive device­ independent graphics for a wide range 
of users, applications, and devices. The package consisted of a large number of subroutines with a 
very complex structure that made comprehension of the source code difficult and execution of the object 
 code inefficient. In particular, the user was faced with a most difficult debugging task when trying 
to understand why the actual pictures did not turn out as desired since it was virtually impossible 
to tell whether the problem lay in the user program or in the graphics package itself. Thus, these 
difficulties led to a project with the following goals: (a) Be simple for the user to understand and 
program.  (b) Provide feedback to user on why the pictures look the way they do.  2. FEATURES The 
basis of SGP is a user-readable file contain­ ing simple information for drawing one or more pictures. 
The SGP file is an intermediate file which is produced by an application program and is then used as 
input to a particular post­ processor to generate a display on a specific device. The uniqueness of 
SGP is that its intermediate file is made up of readable, printable characters. This file can then be 
transmitted via telecommuni­ cation lines without encountering conflicts with communication control 
characters. Since the file can be printed and examined, one may quickly see if the file is sufficient 
to generate any graphical output. Any obviously incorrect intermediate file may be discarded, so that 
no time is wasted generating unreasonable pictures on a graphics device. Furthermore, since it is possible 
to identify the portion of the file generated by each called subroutine, it is fairly easy to identify 
the point in a user's program where a fault occurred. This "desk-checking"may seem unnecessary, but it 
 does provide a user-oriented diagnostic tool; a user can resolve problems that might have remained hidden 
in a complex graphics scheme which would have required a system programmer's help. The use of an on-line 
editor with SGP adds even more use­ fulness to the scheme. Once a user has become familiar with the format, 
he can add, delete, or move vectors, change vector types, correct spell­ing errors in text, add, delete, 
or move lines of text, or delete pictures. In fact, entire pictures can be created by typing the description 
line by line. 3. SGP FORMAT An SGP file consists of blocks of data. Each block begins with a three-to-six 
character mode identifier and ends with an end-of-mode symbol. The modes are vector, text, area, and 
axis. The data between each mode identifier and end-of-mode symbol must be in a precisely defined format 
specific to that mode (described in the Appendix). Pictures are delineated by an end-of-frame symbol. 
One complete picture consists of several blocks of formatted data followed by an end-of-frame symbol; 
many pictures may be stored in a file. Some typical application pictures are shown in Figures 1 and 2. 
 4. OPERATION The production of pictures with SGP is a two-step 224 process (Figure 3). The appl i 
cat ion program In addition to achieving the above goals, the executes on a host computer and makes calls 
to the users have achieved a picture editing capability. SGP subroutines, resulting in the creation of 
the SGP intermediate file. The subroutines available to a user in the current FORTRAN Package are list- 
ed in Figure 4. It is not the intent of this paper to concern itself with the graphics language used 
at the application level. This step of the process is absolutely device independent and is easily transportable 
from one machine or operating system to another. At the NASA Ames Research Center, subroutine packages 
exist for the ~0~7600, IBM 360, and POP-II to enable application pro- grammers on these machines to create 
SGP files. Figure 5 shows a small FORTRAN program that uses SGP to create a simple but significant picture 
that is typical of many engineering applications. The SGP file is shown in Figure 6 and the result- ing 
picture is shown in Figure 7. The remaining task for the host computer is to transfer the SGP file to 
the desired post- processor. Although the host machine may handle several post-processors, it is not 
necessary for it to support any graphics device directly; the SGP file may be transferred to a post-processor 
at another site to generate the pictures. The post-processors play an important part in the total graphics 
scheme. They are all essentially the same; they read theSGP file line-by-line and generate the specific 
hardware commands to draw the picture. Figure 1 5. APPLICATIONS The ideas presented in this paper can 
be of use to any facility considering a graphics system. That is, a host-level subroutine package could 
be provided to assist users in writing an SGP file, or the file could be generated directly by each application 
program. Alternatively, existing facilities that already generate graphics might be modified to produce 
a readable file rather than a picture. This readable file might then be used much like the SGP intermediate 
file for program debugging, and if the file could sub- sequently be sent on to the graphics device, picture 
editing could also be carried out. 6. CONCLUSION The SGP procedures was purposely designed in a simple 
straight forward manner, making it easy to provide both an applications-level graphics subroutine package 
and post-processors to provide the pictures. The resultant program has achieved the desired goals: (a) 
The user-level graphics package consist- ing of short FORTRAN subroutines is easy to explain to users 
and can easily be modified by them to suit a specific purpose. (b) Users quickly see the merit in looking 
Figure 2 at the SGP file for feedback on why the resulting pictures appear as they do. This has greatly 
reduced the amount of consulting required from the graphics systems programmers. Ginit Initializes SGP

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Design of a Low Cost Video Graphics Terminal* by Forest 
Baskett and Leonard Shustek Computer Science Department Stanford University and Computation Research 
Group Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Stanford, California We have designed and built a computer 
terminal that provides low cost, high quality graphics and programmable text processing by taking advantage 
of the latest memory and microprocessor technology. A microprocessor control element allows most of the 
control functions to be programmed SO that all of the control electronics require less than 100 integrated 
circuits. The graphic image is generated by a microprocessor which accepts vector commands intended for 
a Tektronix storage tube display terminal. The microprocessor maps those vector commands into a random 
access memory, and the resulting bit map of the graphic image is displayed on a standard TV monitor. 
Keasonable resolution in the graphic image requires a large number of bits in the bit map, but with the 
use of 4K memory chips, less than 100 integrated circuits are required for the bit map memory in our 
design. At 1975 small-quantity prices, the parts cost for the terminal is approximately $2000. 1. INTKODUCTION 
The desirability of low cost graphics for traditional objections to "soft copy" terminals. many kinds

in the sucess of the processor, the text processing capabilities of the small Tektronix storage tube

to which it is connected and to the low cost graphics in a convenient terminal format. needs of its users. 
In fact, many of the We have designed and built a computer terminal irritating aspects of the terminal

under contract E(043)515. 2. THE GRAPHIC IMAGE Graphics on a" American standard TV monitor can be conveniently 
generated on a 640 by 480 matrix of square dots. By using a large random access memory and a microprocessor 
to manage the bit map of dots we achieve a very clean and simple design. The bit map consists of 307,200 
bits organized as 38,400 B-bit bytes so that it can be easily manipulated by a" g-bit microprocessor. 
The memory chips used are the widely available 4096x1 bit dynamic RAM's, and at least 80 such chips are 
required. Even with the minimum number of RAM'S, there are 2560 bytes of storage which are not part of 
the bit map and may be used by the microprocessor for other purposes. It is convenient to use 96 memory 
chips, so there are 10,752 bytes available for other purposes. A standard TV picture has 480 visible 
scan lines and a 3 to 4 ratio of height to width. With the tube mounted in the standard position we then 
have 480 addressable positions in the vertical direction and 640 addressable positions in the horizontal 
direction. Using all 480 scan lines for different video information requires that the _ alternate-frame 
interlace feature be correctly implemented. G*y text-only TV terminals are simplified by generating the 
same information in both the even and odd frames, and adjusting the timing so that the scan lines are 
not interlaced. The result is at most 24 lines of text with low image quality and a screen refresh rate 
of 60 hertz instead of the normal TV standard of 30 hertz. The higher refresh rate is desirable because 
the standard P4 phosphor appears to f.licker badly when high contrast images are displayed and refreshed 
at 30 hertz. In contrast to that approach, our terminal uses full interlace to get more text and higher 
quality text and graphics, and compensates for the 30 hertz refresh rate by using a TV monitor with a 
green P39 long persistence 'phosphor. The P40 long persistence phosphor with black images on a white 
background also seems acceptable. The 640 by 480 matrix of addressable points of the graphic image is 
almost exactly five eighths of the 1024 by 780 matrix of visible points on the small Tektronix graphics 
terminals (models 4006, 4010, 4012, and 4013). Thus we can accept line drawing commands designed for 
those terminals, scale the coordinates by five eighths (two shifts and a" add), and display the expected 
picture. The resolution of the image is not quite as good, but our superior image contrast seems to more 
than compensate for the slight loss of resolution. Figures 1 and 2 are photographs taken from the TV 
monitor which show typical images created from Tektronix graphic commands. 3. TEXT MODE In text mode, 
the display image memory is no longer a bit map of what is displayed on the screen but instead is a coded 
representation of the text that should be displayed. An 8 bit code permits up to 256 different characters 
to be Fig&#38;s 1 and 2. Photographs of the TV Monitor Image Produced by the VGT. displayed at one time. 
The terminal allows the user (or the computer) to select any two of the three 128-character character 
sets to be active when the terminal is in text mode. By storing a character code instead of an image 
of the character, we reduce the amount of memory necessary for a screen image by a factor of 13. The 
large amount of extra memory thus made available is used to keep a long record of the typescript of a 
terminal session, and "local commands" (key strokes intercepted by the microprocessor) allow the user 
to scroll backward and forward through this typescript. The microprocessor can easily implement a variety 
of scrolling modes. We currently have three such modes. One is a "page-turning mode where a page is one 
screen (37 lines) of text and successive pages overlap by five lines. Another is a high speed mode that 
allows the user to rapidly scan the entire 600 lines of text that can be in the locally stored typescript. 
The third mode is a slow, smooth scrolling that allows the text to be read comfortably as it moves. 4. 
HARDWARE ORGANIZATION As in many graphics terminals, it is convenient to think of the electronics as 
two processors, a display processor and a control processor. Figures 3 and 4 are block diagrams of the 
two processors. The control processor is an 8 bit microprocessor, the Intel 8080 [2]. The display processor 
is a simple collection of counting registers and random logic which we call the video generator. The 
video generator has read-only access to the 48K bytes of graphic image memory. It receives an initial 
display address from the microprocessor during the vertical retrace of the TV monitor. It then fetches 
successive bytes beginning from the initial display address and uses those bytes to generate the video 
image for the current display frame. When the terminal is in graphics mode, the 8 bits from the memory 
are used directly for the intensity information for one eightieth of a raster line (640/8 = 80).  When 
the terminal is in text mode, the 8 bits from the memory together with 4 bits of character row address 
(maintained by the video generator) are used to address one of the character generators which then supplies 
eight bits of intensity information for a segment of the raster line. This fetching, decoding (if necessary), 
and  displaying of each segment of the raster line is pipelined by the video generator because of the 
 timing requirements of the TV monitor and the relatively slow speed of the memories used. One eightieth 
of a raster line must be displayed in 650 nanoseconds, but the access time of the memory chip is 420 
nanoseconds. Thus the eight bit organization and the speed of the memory fit nicely with the speed requirements 
of the video generator. The memory chips used in the terminal have a read cycle time of 700 nanoseconds 
and are dynamic. We must therefore provide for some form of interleaving to prevent consecutive accesses 
to individual chips, and memory refresh to prevent the loss of information. The memory is organized into 
three banks of 16K bytes each and the low order address bit is used to choose between two of the three 
banks so that an access is possible every 650 nanoseconds. The internal construction of the memory chips 
is such that 64 bits are simultaneously refreshed when the chip is addressed even if the output is not 
enabled. By addressing two of the three banks for every sixth or seventh raster line of 80 accesses the 
video generator can refresh the entire memory at the required rate (once every two milliseconds) with 
almost no extra hardware or loss of memory cycles. 237 By not refreshing the memories much more often 
than is required, power dissipation and therefore heat generation is kept to a minimum. The read-only 
character generator is an 8192-bit read-only memory chip organized as 128 64-bit characters. The characters 
are formed on a 7 by 9 bit matrix and the remaining bit of the 64 determines whether the character is 
to be descended an extra 3 raster lines ("g", for example). Thus this character generator displays dots 
on a 7 by 12 submatrix of our 8 by 13 field. The maximum access time of this chip is 500 nanoseconds 
so that if fits easily into the 650 nanosecond pipeline window. The writeable character set is constructed 
from eight 4096-bit static memory chips, which allows 256 different characters each on an 8 by 16 matrix. 
Thus when this character generator is used with our 8 by 13 field, an 8 by 3 submatrix is discarded. 
These memories have a 400 nanosecond cycle time so that they, too, fit in the pipeline window. Static 
memory chips, though more expensive than the dynamic chips used for the bit map, are used for the writeable 
character sets because there is no simple way to guarantee the automatic refresh that dynamic chips require. 
Putting a character 7 bits wide into an 8 bit field means that characters are separated by one bit of 
space. In practice we have found that one bit of space does not give the most visually pleasing text 
so the bits for a character are shifted into the eight bit field slightly faster than the bits of a graph. 
In essence, seven bits of a character are squeezed into a six bit field so that two bits are left between 
characters. Our experiments indicate that this gives the best visual effect. For the writable character 
generator, either the shifting rate of the read only character generator or the shifting rate of graphics 
can be used. Shifting the bits into the 8 bit field slightly faster than the graphic rate provides an 
extra bit of space for characters that should be well separated, and shifting the bits into the field 
at the graphic rate allows characters that are supposed to merge at their boundaries to do so. The control 
processor can set which of the bit clocks will be used for the writable characters (for the entire screen). 
The read-only character generator puts dots on as many as twelve different raster lines because some 
of the 9-bit high characters are descended 3 raster lines. Character lines are displayed in thirteen 
raster lines to insure that there is always at least one completely blank raster line between them. Although 
this would be too-little separation if all text characters were 12 bits high, it is visually pleasing 
since the average separation is four raster lines for pper case and six raster lines for lower case. 
The appearance is not one of double spacing as in many video terminals, and it allows 37 lines of text 
to be on the screen. Since the writable character generators can provide information on as many as 16 
raster lines, the control processor can change the number of raster lines per text line from 13 to 16. 
The result is more space for a text line and fewer (30) text lines per screen. This is desirable for 
character sets containing mathematical or drawing symbols, or for normal characters with diacritic marks. 
 The character row address counter starts at an initial value supplied by the control processor during 
the vertical retrace. Thus the first raster line of the screen may be the nth row of a text line where 
n is greater than one. This shifts the entire screen up by n-l raster lines, and allows the text to be 
scrolled up (or down) one raster line at a time. The rate at which this smooth scrolling is done is controlled 
by the microprocessor, and at a well chosen rate the text can be read comfortably as it moves. Figures 
5 and 6 are photographs of our prototype video graphics terminal. A single lightweight unit (19 lbs) 
contains the keyboard, power supplies, and all electronics; the separate standard TV monitor is a commercially 
available unit. The three small printed circuit boards contain only the 48K byte display memory, and 
the larger wire wrapped board contains the microprocessor, the program and character set memory, the 
serial interface, and all control logic.  FIGURE 5. The Video Graphics Terminal prototypewith the top

6. 5. SOFTWARE ORGANIZATION The overall design philosophy required the control processor software to 
be responsible for as many functions of the terminal as possible. The display address, the display format, 
the keyboard, and the communicationsinterface are all controlled by the microprocessor. The processor 
accepts a single interrupt generated by either the communicationsinterface or the video generator. The 
communications interface generates an interrupt when a new character arrives or when a character has 
completed transmission. The video generator causes an interrupt at the bottom of a frame, indicating 
that vertical retrace is occuring. For interrupts caused by the video generator, the processor must 
send a new display address and an initial row number for the first line of text to the video generator 
for the next video frame. The display address or the initial row number can be adjusted from their 
previous values if the video image is to be scrolled. In addition to sending the display address to 
the video generator, the processor polls the keyboard to see if a new key has been struck or to see 
if the previous key is still depressed; polling the keyboard at 60 hertz is fast enough for even the 
fastest typists.  Timing is done by counting vertical retrace interrupts, which gives the processor 
a 60 hertz line frequency clock. The clock is used for timing such things as the scrolling rate, the 
cursor blink rate, and the keyboard repeat delay and rate. If a key is held  down for two fifths of 
a second, the processor starts repeating that key at a 20 hertz rate. This seems to be as fast as a 
key can be repeated and still allow the typist to stop at a predetermined place on the line. The character 
 repeat rate and typing rate can be faster than the line (baud) rate of the communications interface 
because the microprocessorbuffers characters for  transmission. Since the software of the microprocessor 
 controls the display format and the communications interface,many combinations of local and remote 
editing are possible. Business oriented features such as protected fields and block transmission could 
be handled in a straightforwardmanner by the local software. Local software is stored in 1024x8-bit 
erasable programmable read-only memory chips (Intel 2708 EPROMs). These chips are so easily programmed 
that we have considered building the programmer into terminal. the The terminal could then be instructed 
to accept coded binary text from the remote computer to rewrite the PROM plugged into the programming 
slot. The software is written in assembly language. The assembly language we use is a more elegant and 
powerful one than that provided by the microcomputer manufacturer, and was easily implemented using Assembler 
 language mapping macros on our large computer. Software in the terminal for local text editing is still 
under development, but the software that handles simplecharacter mode transmission, scrolling, and graphics 
(a 4013 simulator) is complete and requires only 2000 bytes of read-only memory (two PROMs). Local text 
editing is a nontrivial problem, and we expect to use another 2000 bytes for a line editor and more 
sophisticated typescript management. We have allowed space for 8192 bytes of read-only memory. If we 
implement features, such as those described by Gerhart and Parnas [3], that take advantage of the high 
display speeds that are possible and the essentially random addressabilityof the display screen, we 
could use most of that program storage. The display memory is logically divided into 600 sequential 
lines of 80 bytes each. Our current system does not use a linked list structure. The linked list structure 
such as that used by the Hewlett-Packard video terminals [4]has advantages such as minimizing storage 
usage and manipulating the typescript with simple changes to a few link fields. With a large amount of 
storage, however, its economical use is not an overriding concern. With the simple linear storage layout, 
the local software is very straightforward. Some operations can be time consuming but our experience 
has shown that these operations are infrequent so that some inefficiency can be tolerated.  Linked structures 
are disadvantageous because it becomes difficult to quantify the time required for certain common operations 
 such as inserting a character in a line. For our memory organization, it would not be a simple matter 
to insure memory refresh with a linked list organization. One desirable feature we could add if we were 
to use a linked list structure would be an ability to display bands of the screen in either graphics 
mode or in character mode.  6. LOCAL PROCESSING SPEED We have run our graphics software at a serial 
interface speed of 2400 baud (240 characters per second) and have had no trouble keeping up with incoming 
graphic commands at that rate, but it is possible that we could not keep up with a higher line speed 
in graphics mode because of a memory accessing limitation we have placed on the microprocessor. We currently 
 do not allow the microprocessor to access the graphic image memory while a scan line is being generated 
by the video generator. The memory is slow enough and simple enough so that if the microprocessor steals 
 a memory cycle during the generation of a scan line, the interference results in annoying "snow" on 
the screen. With the limitation, the microprocessor is able to access the graphic image memory only 
during the horizontal retrace (one two or accesses) and during the vertical retrace (hundreds of accesses). 
Vector drawing commands from the communication line at a rate greater than 240 per second could require 
more graphic image accesses than we can deliver with the "no snow" limitation. However, it is easy 
to remove this restriction and we have made it subject to control by the microprocessor. For example, 
in order to erase the screen as rapidly as possible, the  microprocessor first enables accesses during 
scan line generation, erases all the memory byte by byte, and then disables such cycle stealing. Thus 
 the screen erase is snowy but fast. For the storage of local variables and the subroutine stack, the 
microprocessorhas immediate access to a small 128-byte random access memory. This small memory is not 
part of the bit map memory accessed by the video generator and is thus always available to the microprocessor. 
 7. COSTS The most expensive component of the video graphics terminal is the random access memory used 
 for the graphic image. Buying 100 chips of the type we use (according to the September 1975 list price) 
will cost $1250. Large customer discounts would bring the price down to $800. Price reductions anticipated 
for 1976 will bring the cost down further to $400. We presume that the 16K bit memory chips will eventuallymake 
the memory cost even lower. At that point the cost of the memory balances nicely with the cost of the 
other componentsof the terminal, since keyboards cost between $100 and $300 and TV monitors cost between 
$100 and $300. The most expensive single chip we use is the microprocessor,which can now be purchased 
for $40. There are five other LSI chips used that cost approximately$15 each. The PROM memory chips for 
program storage are new devices and currently sell for $96, but the cost is expected to drop when there 
are multiple sources early in 1976. Nevertheless, using current list prices, the parts cost for the terminal 
is approximately$2000. Since most of the cost is in the electronics where price reductions are expected 
rather than in components like storage tubes where price increases are more likely, we expect that future 
low cost graphic systems will use this approach. 8. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES With existing technology, 
the principal alternative approach that seems feasible is the use of charge-coupled devices (CCD's) rather 
than a random-access memory to store the bit map of the graphic image. The CCD's seem to be ideally 
 suited to the needs of the video generator, which requires only sequential access to the bit map image. 
However, they are far from ideally suited to the needs of the graphic image generator in the microprocessor, 
which accepts commands from the communications interface and must draw vectors between arbitrary points 
on the screen. The bit map of the vector must be created quickly in the graphic image memory so that 
the buffer holding incoming commands will not overflow. Methods for simulating random access to sequential 
memory devices can be devised, but they seem either complicated or slow. Thus while CCD's are excellent 
video output devices, their organization is not appropriate for a video input device of this type. Furthermore, 
the current and projected cost advantage of CCD's over RAM's does not seem to justify the effort necessary 
to use them for this application.  9. FUTURE EXTENSIONS The next obvious step in the development of 
a terminal of this type is the use of a 16 bit microprocessor that addresses 16 bit words (not bytes) 
together with a memory 16 bits wide. This would double the number of bits that could be addressed easily, 
it would double the effective memory bandwidth, and it would substantially increase the computational 
power of the local processor. With such a change, we could perhaps provide higher speed and higher resolution 
graphics, multiple graphic images, more text storage, and more sophisticated local processing. However, 
note that using color or gray scale would each multiply the memory size and bandwidth requirements by 
at least a factor of two. It is tempting to move in the direction of the smaller minicomputersand to 
add a variety of peripheral devices controlled by the local processor. A very useful and easy addition 
would be a mechanism for locating a point on the screen, such as a lightpen or hand-held "mouse". The 
addition of a floppy disk or small tape drive would encourage the development of a more sophisticated 
local screen-oriented text editor, of a local file system, and of a more general and flexible local 
operating system. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We have been ably assisted by Edward H. Frank in the development 
of the software for the microprocessor. We thank Intel Corporation for the donation of some of the parts

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania COMPUTER RENDERING OF LOBSTER NEURONS* Nelson L. Max Department 
of Mathematics and Statistics Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Ohio 44106 At Carnegie Mellon 
University, the PDP-10 and PDP-11 computers have been used to trace thin sections of stained neurons 
in a lobster swimmeret ganglion, and to reconstruct the global structure of the neuron from the sections. 
This paper will present two sorts of graphic pictures of the final reconstructed neuron; vector drawings 
with hidden lines, arui shaded raster drawings of the neuron inside a transparent shell representing 
the outer surface of the ganglion. The hidden line program handles curving cylindrical modification tubes 
of of varying radii, Sproul's version of and the shows Watkins only the visible Algorithm, and contours. 
applies The Phong raster shading program to both is a opaque and semi-transparent surfaces. The shaded 
output is rendered on the Carnegie-Mellon video system. A computer system for reconstructing lobster 
constrained to meet the tree defined by the neurons has been developed at Carnegie-Mellon previous branches, 
but does not necessarily pass University, under the direction of D. R. Reddy, through any of the original 
data nodes. The as described in [l]. The swimmeret ganglion of result is a much smoother looking structure. 
the lobster is serially sectioned, after a single cell is stained with the dye Procion yellow. Both the 
outline of the ganglion surface and the pieces of the stained neuron are traced from enlargements of 
each section, and digitized using a spark pen. This data is edited and compressed by the PDP-11 computer, 
and sent to a PDP-10 computer. The reconstruction program then joins the stained neuron into a tree structure 
whose nodes are the traced sections. Its output is a list of modes, and a description of how they are 
connected, together with the coordinates of each node, and the measured radius of the tubular process 
as it crosses the section. The ganglion surface sections are also joined into a smooth three dimensional 
surface. This paper will describe several graphical representations of the reconstructed neuron and ganglion. 
Figure 1. The first twelve figures are Polaroids taken from the ARDS display screen. Figure 1, shows 
the tree structure of a reconstructed neuron, Figure 2 shows a first attempt at smoothing, with the principal 
branches represented by spline curves. In Figure 3, the interpolated spline curves have been replaced 
by least square approximations. These are defined in decreasing order with the branch of largest volume 
taken first, and then succeeding branches added. Each new branch is * This work was supported by the 
National Science Foundation under contract No. GJ 32784 241 Figure 4 shows the same initial data from 
a different viewing angle, and figure 5 shows the corresponding least squares approximation. In figure 
6, the principal branches only are drawn, and figure 7 shows these branches as tubes of varying radii, 
using a least squares fit to the radii measured in the sections. Figure 8 shows the same tubular structure 
in perspective, with hidden lines removed. Hemispherical caps have been drawn to close off the ends of 
the tubes. The hidden line program works by representing the tubes by a sequence of adjacent polygons, 
as shown in figure 9. These polygons are then used to hide the lines behind them, applying standard tests 
to check if a line segment is wholly or partially hidden. Fig. 2 - Fig. 5 - Fig. 3 - Fig. 6 - Fig. 4

first few branches of figure 10, which represents an artifically defined tree structure. Figures 11 and 
12 show two views of the "Alexander Horned Sphere," which results when the branches of this tree are 
curved to interlock in a complex way, without touching each other. This Horned Sphere is an example of 
an embedding of a sphere into three dimensional space which is so tangled that its complement is not 
homeomorphic to the complement of a round sphere. Fig. 10 - Fig. 10 ­Fig. 12 - Fig. 12 - 243 Fig. 11 
- Figure 13 shows a semi-transparent model of the ganglion surface. The surface was represented by a 
polygonal approximation to the smoothed data. Polygons which curved past the profile were subdivided 
as described in [2], to give a smooth profile curve. The Watkins hidden surface program was used for 
the X and Y sort of the polygons. The sophisticated partial Z sort, which only remembers polygons which 
are potentially visible if all surfaces are opaque, was replaced by a complete Z sort. For each raster 
element on the screen, the intensity was computed by taking the sorted polygons in order from rear to 
front, assuming each polygon reflected a certain amount of light, and transmitted a certain amount of 
the light reaching it from behind. These reflection and transmission coefficients were simple functions 
of the angles between the surface normal, the light source, and the line to the point of view. The normal 
to the surface at the point corresponding to the displayed raster point was computed by inter­polating 
between normal vectors specified at the vertices of the polygons, as suggested by Phong [3]. The author 
wishes to thank Robert Sproull for sending him his version of the Watkins Algorithm from the computer 
typescript of the appendix to Interactive Computer Graphics [4]. Fig. 13 - Fig. 13 Figures 14 and 15 
show the neuron inside the ganglion surface, as an opaque white object, and a shaded object, respectively. 
Figure 16 shows a close up, lit from above, so that the shading and hidden surface algorithms help reveal 
its three dimensional structure. The semi trans­ parent nature of the ganglion surface also indicates 
that the neuron is behind it. 244  Fig. 14 - Fig. 14 - Fig. 15 - Fig, 15 --Fig. 16 - Fig. 16 - These 
raster pictures were drawn on a color video system built by Mike Powell at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Since the present memory bandwidth of this device limits the output to 16 grey levels at the horizontal 
raster resolution used here, a random jitter was added to the intensity to soften the edges between these 
levels. The checkerboard in the background was added to highlight the semi transparent nature of the 
surface, as suggested by Frank Crow's goblet [5]. REFERENCES [1] D. R. Reddy, W. J. Davis, R. B. Ohlander,

			<par><![CDATA[Conventional radiographic imaging techniques are not adequate for determination of the true, dynamic changes in shape and dimensions of the intact working heart, lungs and circulation which are required for accurate quantitative determination of the structure and function of these organ systems. This paper describes a computerized method for obtaining images of the dynamic spatial distribution of x-ray attenuation throughout multiple parallel cross-sectional planes bisecting the intact thorax, with 1-mm spatial resolution and 60-per-second temporal resolution, and for generating time delay video and cine displays of the spatial and temporal sequences of these cross-sectional images. Operator-interactive computer programs facilitate the dynamic display of reconstructed cross sections of the heart and lungs, with or without dynamic background subtraction, and permit calculation and display of any desired single or spatially related set of coronal, sagittal or obliquely oriented sections. Such displays permit viewing of the temporal and spatial distribution of contraction, expansion, and perfusion of these organs over their full anatomic extent in various orientations and in variable time-base modes ranging from stop-action to real-time. The results achieved with this computerized system for three-dimensional reconstruction and display of moving organs, particularly the heart, lungs, and circulation, demonstrate the potential for providing greatly improved techniques for investigation of the relationships of the dynamic three-dimensional anatomy and blood-tissue exchange properties of moving organ systems to their regional and integrated function, and ultimately for providing powerful new clinical diagnostic methods for elucidation of abnormalities of the heart, lungs and circulation in man.]]></par>

HEART, LUNGS AND CIRCULATION BY COMPUTERIZEDRECONSTRUCTIONAND SUBTRACTION TECHNIQUES* Richard A. ROBB,

and Earl H. WOOD Biophysical Sciences Unit, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mayo Graduate School 
of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55901 Conventional radiographic imaging techniques are not adequate 
for determination of the true, dynamic changes in shape and dimensions of the intact working heart, lungs 
and circulation which are required for accurate quantitativedetermination of the structure and function 
of these organ systems. This paper describes a com­puterized method for obtaining images of the dynamic 
spatial distribution of x-ray attenuation throughout multiple parallel cross-sectional planes bisecting 
the intact thorax, with 1-mm spatial resolution and 60-per-second temporal resolution, and for generating 
time delay video and cine displays of the spatial and temporal sequences of these cross-sectional images. 
Operator-interactivecomputer programs facilitate the dynamic display of reconstructedcross sections 
of the heart and lungs, with or without dynamic background subtraction, and permit calculation and display 
of any desired single or spatially related set of coronal, sagittal or obliquely oriented sections. Such 
displays permit viewing of the temporal and spatial distribution of contraction, expansion, and perfusion 
of these organs over their full anatomic extent in various orientations and in variable time-base modes 
ranging from stop-action to real-time. The results achieved with this computerized system for three-dimensionalreconstructionand 
display of moving organs, partic­ularly the heart, lungs, and circulation,demonstrate the potential for 
providing greatly improved techniques for investigationof the relationships of the dynamic three-dimensionalanatomy 
and blood-tissue exchange properties of moving organ systems to their regional and integrated function, 
and ultimately for providing powerful new clinical diagnostic methods for elucidation of abnormalitiesof 
the heart, lungs and circulation in man. 1. INTRODUCTION It is of fundamental importance in stud­ 
ies of cardiovascularand pulmonary physiology and for obtaining more accu­rate clinical assessments of 
regional heart, lung, and circulatory function to measure and analyze the dynamic regional changes in 
geometry, perfusion and ten­ sion of these organ systems. The func­ tion and performance of the heart, 
lungs and circulation are inseparably linked to their motion in three dimensions (1,2). However, satisfactory 
noninvasive methods have not as yet been established for determinationof the true, dynamic *This work

in shape and dimensions of the intact heart and lungs or for accurate three-dimensionalmeasurement 
of the dis­ tribution of blood flow to, from, and within these and other organ systems of the body. Such 
measurementsare required for accurate quantitative studies of the structure and function of these organ 
 systems to be carried out. Although current computerizedx-ray tomo­graphic systems, such as the ACTA 
(3), DELTA (4), and EMI (5) whole-body scan­ners, produce remarkably accurate anatomic images of any 
single cross section of the body, they cannot provide, due to their limited axial scan range and relatively 
long scan times (20 seconds or longer), high spatial and temporal resolution transaxial images over the 
entire anatomic extent of moving organs such as the heart, lungs and circulation. X-ray video imaging 
techniques, coupled with precise computer synchronizationof physiological events, provide the capa­bility 
of noninvasivelyrecording multiplanar images of the entire chest and its contents with high spatial 
and temporal resolution from which dynamic complete three-dimensionalreconstructions of intrathoracic 
organs can be determined (6,7). 2. METHODS Fig. 1 diagramaticallyillustrates the system developed 
in our laboratory for generation and collection of two-dimen­sional multiangular x-ray projection images 
using a computer-controlledsingle­source single-detector x-ray fluoroscopic system. The x-ray imaging 
chain, shown at the bottom of the figure, is a new high performance state-of-the-artvideo­fluoroscopic 
system, unique in its design and construction,which we call the SSDSR for single source dynamic spatial 
recon­structor (8).  Fig. 1 -Diagram of computer­controlled single-sourcesingle­detector x-ray video 
system (SSDSR) for collection of multiplanar roentgen video projections for dynamic spatial reconstructionsof 
the intact thorax and its contents. The object to be reconstructed is posi­tioned in the x-ray field 
of the SSDSR and rotated under computer-controlabout an axis perpendicular to the central plane of x-ray 
beams. The fluoroscopic image at each successive angle of view is scanned by the video camera, producing 
an electronic video signal representation of the image, which is made up of approxi­mately 500 horizontal 
scan lines. Each line in the video image represents the projections of an approximately1-mm thick section 
of the object scanned. Measurements of the transmitted x-ray in­tensities on each video line are made 
by the video digitizer (9) and are repeated on the same lines for each successive view of the object 
as it is rotated in arc of 180 to 360 . Typically two minutes are required to complete digiti­ equi-angular 
increments through a total ° ° zation of all lines in all recorded angles of view. These x-ray transmission 
measurements provide the data required for determinationof up to 500 parallel adjacent cross sections 
of the object, or, in other words, its complete three­dimensional reconstruction. Reconstructionof a 
moving object, such as a beating heart within the thorax of a live animal, requires maintenance of exact 
temporal relationshipsbetween physiologicalevents and x-ray projection image recording. This is accomplished 
by slaving all components of the system, including the computer, to the master oscillator, labeled SYNC 
in the slide, which controls the video sweep circuits of the video camera. The rate and phase of the 
cardiac and respiratory cycles are kept constant and synchronizedwith the rotation, x-ray pulses, video 
re­cording and digitizing process by computer-controlledventilation of the lungs and pacing of the atria 
and ventri­cles, all in exact temporal relationship with the 60-per-secondoscillator pulses. The ECG 
and other hemodynamic variables are simultaneouslyrecorded with the video images on a videotape or video 
disc (10) so that sets of images, recorded at the same phase of successive respiratory and cardiac cycles 
at each incremental angle of view can be selected for each point in time throughout the respiratory and 
cardiac cycles to obtain complete dynamic spatial reconstructions of the thorax and its contents. Fig. 
2 schematicallyillustrates how a single transverse cross section of an  Fig. 2 -Schematic diagram of 
 geometric considerationsfor re­ construction of a cross section of the heart (see ref. 11). object 
(in this case the heart) is deter-mined using an algebraic reconstruction technique (12). The transaxial 
planetraversed by the x-ray beam which contains the desired cross section of the object to be reconstructed 
is mathematicallydivided into a set of small squares of arbitrary size (typically 64 x 64 up to 128 x 
128) and the intensity of the x-raybeam transmitted through that plane is measured at several points 
(up to 1 000 along the detector for each rotational position of the x-ray source and detector with respect 
to the object. The geometricconsiderations are the same if the source and detector are rotated about 
the object or if the object is rotated with respect to a fixed source and detector. The transmitted x-ray 
beam measurements from the detector are related to measurements of the incident x-ray beam (obtained 
by removing the object from the system) for all angles of view by a system of linear equations in which 
the unknowns are the x-ray beam attenuation coefficients in each small square of the grid. The alge-braic 
solution of this system of equationsprovides an array of numbers which can be displayed as a matrix of 
picture elements with individual brightness levels pro-portional to the attenuation coefficients in each 
small square. Such a display re-sults in an image of the cross-sectional structure of the object scanned. 
More recently we have implemented a fan-beam convolution reconstruction algorithm (13) which operates 
on multiplanar pro-jection data recorded in this same waybut which is faster and produces somewhat better 
cross-sectional images of the thorax than are obtained with the alge-braic technique. The left-hand panel 
in fig. 3 is a photo-graph of a video monitor upon which is displayed the thorax of an intact dog,supported 
in the head-up position, which was recorded with the SSDSR system. The white area on either side of the 
dog re-presents the unattenuated x-ray beam impinging on the fluorescent screen and demonstrates the 
superior dynamic rangeof this system, by comparison to conven-tional fluoroscopic equipment, in as much 
as the spine can be seen through the heart shadow, and other intrathoracic structures, including the 
radiopaque 2-mm diameter catheters, are simultaneously imaged with the unattenuated x-ray. No x-ray contrast 
material has been injected into the dog to produce this image. The brightenedhorizontal line superimposed 
upon the thoracic image represents the projectionof the central fan of x-ray beams onto the fluorescent 
screen, and depicts the ana-tomic level selected for the cross-sec-tional reconstruction of the dog's 
thorax shown in the right-hand panel of fig. 3. This reconstruction, produced in one mi-nute by a fan-beam 
convolution algorithm, is typical of the best reconstructions we have been able to achieve to date. Note 
the spinal vertebra and spinal chord, ribs, pleural surfaces of the lungs, the esophagus, bifurcated 
trachea, epicardialsurfaces of the heart, and the two cath-eters in the heart. Some trapped air which 
leaked through the catheters can be seen in the chambers of the heart. The spatial and contrast resolution 
achieved in this reconstruction is very encour-aging, considering fluoroscopic x-ray levels and video 
recording techniques were used. Fig. 3 -Photograph of thorax (left panel) of an intact dog supported 
in the head-position in SSDSR system and reconstructed cross section (right panel) of thorax at level

cross sections can be reconstructed at a temporal re- solution of 60-per-second throughout suc- cessive 
cardiac and/or respirators cycles. That is, the SSDSR scans can produce- dynamic, high axial spatial 
resolution and large axial range cross-sectional images whrch cannot be achieved by other current- ly 
operational CT scanners; and which are required for detailed quantitative anal- ysis of the dynamic regional 
and syner- gistic function of the heart, lungs and circulation. Fig. 4 depicts 64 brightened l-mm thick 
video lines, each 3-mm apart, covering the anatomic extent of the thorax of an intact dog, which were 
selected from one rotational scan for reconstruction of 64 cross sections of the dog's chest. The two 
lines between each level were also digitized and averaged with each Fig. 5 -Sixteen parallel 3-mm thick

12-mm intervals extending from the apex of the lungs (upper left) to the base of the lungs (lower right). 
A very useful advantage of full spatial anatomic reconstructions of the thorax such as these is that 
multiple parallel sections oriented at any desired angle in relation to the x, y and z axes of the thorax 
can be computed from the.re- constructed transverse images, and dis- played for viewing of the thorax 
from any aspect. Fig. 6 is a computer-generated displayof 16 parallel 3-mm thick coronal sections, Fig. 
4 -Photograph of thorax of intact dog with superimposed brightened horizontal lines at 64 levels selected 
for cross section reconstruction. Fig. 5 shows 16 of these reconstructed cross sections (every fourth 
line in fig. 4, hence 12-mm apart) from the apex of the lungs, at the upper left of the figure, extending 
cephalo-caudally to the diaphragmatic margin at the base of the lungs, at the lower right of the figure, 
in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. The spinal vertebra, ribs as they Fig. 6 -Sixteen parallel 3-mm 
thick course through the plane of the cross coronal sections of dead dog thorax section, the bifurcated 
airway, the In 12-mm increments extend&#38; from epicardial surfaces of the heart, and the sternum (upper

Some trapped air in the bowel of 64 parallel transverse sections, can be seen in the lower row of cross 
of which 16 are shown in fig. 5. 12-mm apart through the thorax, extendingin 4 rows, left-to-right and 
top-to-bot­tom, from the sternum at the upper leftto the backbone at the lower right. These 3-mm thick 
coronal sections were computedfrom 64 reconstructed transverse sections of the chest of which 16 are 
shown in fig. 5. Note the ribs in the chest wall,the catheters in the heart (in row 2),the trachea and 
esophagus (in row 3) andthe detail of the backbone (in row 4). Fig. 7 is a similar display of sagittalsections 
extending from the left side ofthe thorax (at the upper left) to theright side of the thorax (at the 
bottomright) computed from the same set of 64reconstructed transverse sections. Fig. 8 illustrates a 
sequence of thoraciccross-sectional reconstructions of a living dog's chest, with no x-ray con­ trast 
material injected, obtained fromtemporally correlating sets of digitizedmultiplanar x-ray images of the 
thoraxrecorded during rotation of the dog inangular increments on successive res­piratory cycles. Each 
row of sec­ tions represents three different anatomiclevels of the chest; the top, center, andbottom 
rows corresponding respectively tothe apical, mid, and basal levels of the thorax; and each column of 
cross sections represent three different phases of therespiratory cycle, the left, center, andright columns 
corresponding, respectively, to the end-expiratory, mid-inspiratory,and end-inspiratory phases of the 
respi­ratory cycle. Hence, this montage of images illustrates both dynamic (in thehorizontal direction) 
and spatial (in thevertical direction) reconstructions made from a single rotational scan. Fig. 8 -Reconstructed 
thoracic cross sections of the intact lungs andheart-of a living dog reconstructedat three different 
anatomic levels (rows) and at three different pointsin the respiratory cycle (columns). Fig. 9 shows 
a single cross-sectionallevel near the mid-plane between thebase and apex of an intact, beating heartwithin 
the thorax of a living dog recon­structed at 12 successive points through­out the cardiac cycle, with 
each successivepoint in time being 33 msec apart. Duringthe rotation period of approximately 25seconds, 
respiration was suspended andx-ray contrast material was continuously infused into the left ventricular 
chamber to achieve constant beat-to-beat opac­ ification of the chamber during therotational scan period. 
The left ventricular chamber and epicardialsurfaces of the heart can be seen in each successive image 
in the first two rowsduring the isovolumic and contractilephases of the systolic period, followedby the 
subsequent diastolic filling periodshown in the bottom row. The upper left­hand image corresponds to 
end-diastole,and is coincident in time with the com­puter pacing pulse (or "R" wave) whichinitiates the 
contraction. These cross sections demonstrate the here­tofore unobtainable capability for deter­mination 
of the dynamic cross-sectionalshape and dimensions of both the epi- andendocardial surfaces of the intact 
work­ing heart in living animals over theentire anatomic and temporal extents ofthe myocardial walls 
and cardiac cycle,respectively. Display of the three-dimensional image information obtained by these 
techniques is an important factor in establishing the usefulness of these capabilities inbasic research 
and clinical practice. Time delay video and cine recordings of the temporal and spatial sequences of 
the computer-generated cross section recon­ structions illustrated in these figureshave been made. These 
sequences of cross sections reconstructed over the full anatomical extent of the beating heartand breathing 
lungs throughout successivecardiac and respiratory cycles, respec­ tively, in isolated preparations and 
in intact dogs can be viewed in variable time base modes ranging from stop-action to real-time. Such 
dynamic displaysprovide the capability for studying the spatial relationships and instant-to instant 
changes in geometry of theseorgans and permits evaluation of theirregional and integrated overall function 
in the intact thorax. An example of how three-dimensionalimages can be displayed to permit anal­ysis 
of the spatial relationships and re­gional detail of image structures isillustrated in figs. 10 and 11. 
Fig. 10shows a sequence of 4 reconstructed crosssections from base-to-apex of an isolated,dead canine 
heart whose chambers and coronary arteries were filled with cottonand barium paste, respectively, prior 
torotation and digitization of a total of48 video lines selected for cross-sec­tional reconstruction. 
The characteristic cross-sectional shapesof the epi-and endocardial surfaces of both the left and right 
ventricles at eachof 4 selected levels are accurately recon­structed. In.addition, the cross Fig. 11

ref. 14).  sections of the coronary arteries as theytraverse the myocardial walls can be seenas bright 
spots (more x-ray dense) at eachcross-sectional level. These arteries are approximately 2-mm in diameter 
near thebase of the heart (upper-left crosssection) and 0.5 mm in diameter near theapex of the heart 
(lower-right crosssection). Fig. 11 shows four three-dimensionalperspective line displays of the coronary 
tree of the heart at successive 50" angles of view determined from the co­ ordinate positions of the 
coronary arteries, which were entered into the computer using an operator-interactivedisplay and light 
pen assembly, in eachof the 48 parallel cross sections of the heart reconstructed from its base to apex. 
By performing rotational matrix operations on these sets of x,y, z coordinates, line representations 
of the coronary tree can be viewed from any orientation in stop­ action or during continuous rotation 
to facilitate studies of the geometric re­ lationships of the coronary artery system. Similar three-dimensional 
displays of the complete coronary vessels, obtained by entering into the computer the entire cross section 
of each artery at each re­ constructed level, permit regional struc­ tural details (i.e., narrowing) 
to be examined as well. Fig. 12 is a computer-generated gray level plot of two cross sections of an isolated 
beating left ventricle recon­ structed near the base (left) and apex (right) of the ventricle during 
the same instant in the cardiac cycle. The myocardium is depicted by points with different gray levels 
which are propor­tional to the degree of stress at eachpoint location in a direction perpendicularto 
the plane of the reconstructed crosssection. These values are determined bymathematically dividing the 
cross-sec­tional image of the myocardium into alinked set of several hundred triangularelements and, 
by using finite elementanalysis techniques (15), computing thestresses at each node of each triangleon 
the basis of the cross-sectional shapeof the myocardium and the simultaneouslymeasured transmural cardiac 
pressures.This type of display in which measured or calculated physiological variables are superposed 
upon the reconstructed cross­ sectional anatomy permits simultaneous analysis of structure and function 
of the object being studied. By using three-dimensional boundary surface detection and three-dimensional 
computer graphics techniques (namely,hidden surface removal and shading), the three-dimensional reconstruction 
of ob­ jects can be presented in the form of three-dimensional displays. The left-hand panel in fig. 
13 is acomputer-generated three-dimensional surface display of a whole isolatedcanine heart which was 
determined byautomatic three-dimensional boundarydetection of 30 reconstructed cross­sectional levels 
of the heart. The right-hand panel in fig. 13 is a three­dimensional gray-level surface displayof the 
same heart but mathematicallyopened into halves to permit viewing ofthe structural detail of the intra-chamber 
surfaces. Fig.. 14 is a computer-generated graylevel surface display of the leftventricular chamber of 
a dog upon whichiso-stress contour lines have been super­imposed (16). This type of multi­dimensional 
display is useful for quanti­tative evaluation and study of the inter­relationship between structure 
andfunction of the heart. The usefulness of these kinds of displaysdepends a great deal on the display 
for­mat. The illusion of three-dimensionalitycan be enhanced with stereo pairs gener­ated by mathematically 
rotating theoriginal surface through a small angleand displaying the original and rotated chamber detail.

pairs is to display images alter­nately field-by-field on a televisionmonitor and view the image throughglasses 
which become alternately opaqueto each eye synchronously with the dis­play of the image fields. The capability 
provided by the videoimage digitizing system for obtaininghigh spatial (up to 2 000 samples on eachof 
250 lines per video field) and hightemporal (60 video fields per second) re­solution measurements for 
cross-sectional reconstruction of moving organs alsopermits the study of the appearance, meantransit 
and clearance of x-ray contrast substances through, for example, the myo­cardium with a degree of anatomical 
andtemporal precision not possible by currentradioisotope techniques. This capabilityis indicated in 
fig. 15 which illustrates the quantitative determination by dynamicbackground subtraction of the spatial 
dis­tribution of the coronary circulationwithin the myocardium of a patient under­going selective coronary 
arteriography. Fig. 15 -Comparison of actualx-ray video images (left column)of human heart recorded 
duringselective coronary arteriographywith digitized, computer-generatedsubtraction images (right column)computed 
at same point in threesuccessive cardiac cycles (seeref. 18). 253 Each computer-generateddifference image 
 (right-handpanels, 1-3) of contrast dis­tribution at the same specific phase of three successive heart 
beats following the injection of contrast material is obtained by subtraction, sample for sample, of 
the digitized arrays of the video images recorded during and following the injection (left panel) from 
the digitized arrays of the video images re­ corded just prior to the injection. Simultaneous ECG recording 
on the video­tape allows precise temporal and phasic registration between the pre-injection video images 
and the post-injectionvideo images which are subtracted to produce difference pictures at each point 
in the cardiac cycle throughout successive post­injection cycles. By combining dynamic three-dimensionalre­construction 
techniques with dynamic sub­ traction techniques, the instant-to-instant regional changes in shape and 
dimensions and transmural perfusion of the myocardium (and other organ systems) can be accurate­ly and 
completely studied. 3. DISCUSSION Cross sections over the entire anatomic extent of the intact, working 
heart and lungs at different instants during the cardiac and respiratory cycles have been successfully 
reconstructed in our labo­ratory from images obtained by rotating live, anesthetized dogs in the x-ray 
field of a single x-ray source, single image detector system while controlling respiration and pacing 
the heart in exact synchrony with the video scan rate and pulsing of the x-ray source. Although the 
margins of the lungs and epicardial surfaces of the heart can be readily recognized in such cross sections, 
intracardiac detail is limited due to beat-to-beat variations in cardiac geo­metry and to insufficient 
roentgen opacity gradients between the myocardium and the circulating volumes of blood during the 20-to-120-secondperiod 
of time re­quired for rotation and recording. En­ hanced blood-to-musclex-ray density gradients achieved 
by intravenous in­fusion of conventional radiopaque con­trast materials cannot be uniformly maintained 
without physiologicalpertur­ bations for this period of time. This difficulty in producing anatomical 
 and circulatory stationarity, which would be impractical to impose upon patients if it could be achieved, 
and which most cer­tainly does not occur naturally during normal spontaneous activity, and most particularly 
does not occur in patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease, makes very improbable the effective use 
of electrocardiographicgating of any me­ chanical scanning procedure for obtaining 254 accurate reconstructions 
of moving organs such as the heart and lungs. These con­ siderations indicate that dynamic three­ dimensional 
reconstructionof the heart within the intact thorax of a living dog or human requires development of 
an all electronic device which can record ap­ proximately30 multiplanar x-ray images of the total heart 
practically instan­ taneously, and at frequent enough inter­ vals of time and with sufficient density 
 and spatial resolution to capture and re­ solve the most rapid changes in cardiac structural detail 
and circulation over the entire anatomic extent of the heart throughout each cardiac cycle. Our pre­ 
liminary results with a single-source, single-detector prototype unit of such an imaging system indicate 
that such a de­ vice, which would be equally suitable for use in a clinical diagnostic setting as well 
as in a research environment for determinationand display in real-time modes of cross sections of the 
function­ ing thorax and its contents of unanes­ thetized living animals and man, is technologicallyand 
practically feasible (19). Fig. 16 is a diagram of such a complete dynamic spatial reconstruction 
(DSR)sys­ tem. The twenty-eight sets of image­ intensifiers and image isocon video cameras are arranged 
behind the curved fluorescent screen to produce twenty-eight video images of the 30 cm x 30 cm over­lapping 
roentgen projection images pro­duced on the screen. One complete scan is accomplished in 0.01 second 
by pulsing each of the x-ray sources in succession for 0.34 milliseconds. Total incident dose for successive 
60-per-second scans lasting for two seconds (i.e., about two heart beats) would be approximately 2 r. 
 The video images are multiplexed onto four video discs for immediate storage. Following transfer of 
these recorded data to the computer, up to sixty adjacent cross sections can be reconstructedfrom these 
data for every 1/60th second of operation of the DSR.  ponents and data flow path associated with dynamic 
spatial reconstructor (DSR). High-speed parallel processing recon­struction techniques (i.e., convolution 
implemented in special purpose hardware) will permit computation speeds of about 1/60th a second per 
cross section, that is, two minutes for the entire scan pro­cedure. Such rapid processingwill be essential 
for effective clinical use of the full potentialities of the DSR. 2. 3. E. H. Wood, E. L. Ritman, R.

A PROPOSED SYSTEM TO GENERATETHOSE DISPLAYS* Joseph J. CAPOWSKI Department of Physiology, University 
of North Carolina Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27514 Computer graphics displays in the neurosciences 
are classified into three categories: ana­ tomical structures, physiologicalwaveforms, and statistical 
summaries. The capabilities required in a line drawing system to present neuroscience displays are smooth 
rotation and translation of 3D structures, simple line rejection, orthographic projection, and flexible 
 interactivehard copy capable of drawing dots. The general purpose computer is available to refresh

are discussed. 1. INTRODUCTION For several years I have been the director of a computer center used 
to collect and analyze neuro­physiologicaland neuroanatomicaldata. The center is based around a DEC PDP-11/45 
general purpose computer and Evans and Sutherland LDS-2 line drawing graphics system. The role of the 
graphics system must be emphasized; experience has shown that the primary output form from the com­puter 
to the neuroscientistis the CRT display and its hard copy. The graphics form is easily understood by 
the scientist and allows him to feel comfortable in an unfamiliar environment. Much work has been done 
by graphic display man­ ufacturers and by university researchers in de­ fining new display algorithms, 
new display tech­ nologies, and new display hardware. Much less thought has been given to what the user 
really needs. I have been unable to find in the liter­ ature a presentation of the needs of computer 
 graphics users in the neurosciences. This paper is an attempt to fill that void. From my ex­ perience, 
I shall try to define what graphic displays neuroscientists generate and then pro­ pose a simple graphics 
system which allows easy generation of those displays. 2. CHARACTERISTICSOF NEUROSCIENCEGRAPHIC DISPLAYS 
 Neuroscience graphic displays attempt to convey information about a neuroanatomicalor neuro­ physiological 
system to a scientist. This in­ formation almost always takes one of three forms. The first form, two 
examples of which are shown in fig. 1, is a display of structural information  about neuroanatomical 
tissue features. The dis-Fig. 1 -Three dimensional neuroanatom­ play is formed of many short lines. The

general purpose modeling program [1]. This display is composed of about 1600 short lines. It is taken 
from [4].  might be two or three dimensional. The two dimen­sional case may be considered a subset of 
the three dimensional case. The three dimensional case oc­curs so often in neuroanatomy that it must 
be con­ sidered. The second form of information,an example of which is shown in fig. 2, is a presentation 
of e­ lectrical waveforms recorded from an animal. The X axis in these displays is usually time, but 
 could be some other parameter which varies with time.  Fig. 2 -Action potential waveforms re­corded 
from the peripheral nervous system of a rabbit. Each waveform is composed of 70 short lines. This figure 
is taken from [2]. The third form of information,two examples of which are shown in fig. 3, is a display 
of graphs, usually statistical distributions of neuroanatom­ical features or neurophysiologicalevents. 
The examples show the need to easily display both lines and dots.   Fig. 3 -Statistical summaries 
of neuro­ anatomical features and neurophysiological events. (a) An interpoint distancehis­ togram of 
all terminals of a neuron axon tree. (b)A graph of instantaneous fre­ quency and stimulus temperature 
versus time for action potentials of the type displayed in fig. 2. This figure is taken from [2]. 
 In all of the above cases the information conveyed is not realistic. The display is not a copy of a 
 real object which a person could hold in his hand or see through a window. Because of the lack of 
realism, many of the computer graphics techniques designed to generate a realistic display from a computer-storedmathematical 
model are of little value. The remainder of this section discusses which techniques are necessary for 
neuroscience displays. Most of the features to be discussed apply to hard copy as well as to CRT displays. 
 Structure data for the three dimensional displays are stored in a computer memory display file of 
three dimensional coordinates. The ability to smoothly rotate and translate the picture in real time 
is necessary for the scientist to understand the structure. Since the number of lines in a display may 
be fairly high (greater than 2000), the real time rotation calculation must be per­formed in special 
purpose hardware, probably as a matrix multiplication. For the waveform and graph displays, no real 
time rotation is required. Translation, or a relative drawing capability can easily be performed in 
matrix multiplicationhard­ware. Because the display file stored in the computer is not updated in rotation 
and transla­ tion, the remaining transformationsapplied to the rotated figure must also be performed 
in special hardware. After the picture has been rotated and trans­ lated, some parts of the picturemay 
not be in the scientist's view according to some definition of his viewing limits. Since the structure 
is composed entirely of short lines, a simple line rejection scheme which rejects a line if either end 
of the line is out of view can be used with­out degrading the picture appreciably. The simple rejection 
scheme is ideally suited for  waveform displays. In the case of graphs, the problem does not arise as 
it is assumed that graphs are drawn entirely in view. Once it has been determinedwhich parts of the 
 three dimensional structure are to be shown, the projection onto a two dimensional display sur­ face 
occurs. Two projections, orthographic and one point perspective, are in general use. Fig. 4 shows an 
anatomical structure in both projections. For the structuresdisplayed in neuroscience work, the orthographic 
projectionis much more natural. Also, the apparent distortion caused by the per­ spective projection 
is greatly enhanced during smooth rotation. Our experience has shown that a smoothly rotating orthographic 
projectionprovides a most pleasant and effective way to study a three dimensional structure. The simplicity 
of the or­ thographic projection,ignoring Z after rotation, adds to its appeal.  la. It has been rotated 
300 degrees about the X axis. (a) Orthographic projection. (b) Perspective projection. The tree is 
apparently distorted by the perspectiveprojection. Depth cueing by varying the CRT beam intensity with 
Z has proven to be of little value. Possibly this is because a scientist wishes to examine a struc­ture 
as if it were a cube two feet on a side held at arms length. In such an examination, light transmitted 
to the scientist's eyes from distance points in the cube would not be noticeably more attenuated than 
light transmitted from near points. For two dimensional displays, of course, depth cueing does not apply. 
 Various line types, for example dashed, blinking, dotted, have been attempted for some applications. 
Our experience has shown that the extra amount of informationwhich can be passed to the scientist through 
the use of various line types is not great enough to justify the effort to build line type capabilitiesinto 
the display hardware. The data tablet is a good tracing device. Un­ fortunately the data tablet requires 
scientist preparation time for its use. Our experience has shown that the use of the data tablet for 
pointing applications, for example menu selection, is an­noying. The hardcopy device should be able 
to make a copy of the CRT display at any time. Flexibility in the use of the device is quite important. 
It must be possible to draw a plot and then, say, draw another plot in a new color superimposed on the 
 first one. The type of flexibility cannot be de­ fined in a program. It must be possible for the scientist 
to manipulate the plotter to achieve the desired effects. The use of different symbols to indicate 
different data types is quite messy when the amount of data is high. Different colors indicate different 
data types much more clearly. The hardcopy device must have the ability to draw dots. Ball point pen 
plotters cannot perform this task. A complete list of plotting needs is pre­ sented in [3]. Once a 
neurosciencedisplay has been started, the computer system waits for a scientist's command from some 
interactive device. The command could be to modify the display or to stop the display, possibly to generate 
another display. During the display the computer is either executing a polling loop of interactive 
devices or is idle awaiting an interrupt from an interactive device. During the neuroscience displays, 
no time consuming computer calculations are necessary. Therefore the computer could be used to refresh 
the display. 3. A PROPOSED SYSTEM FOR COMPUTER GRAPHICS DISPLAY IN THE NEUROSCIENCES A simple, low 
cost display processor, capable of generating the displays described in the previous section has been 
built and is now being debugged. This neuroscience display processor (NDP) re­ quired about 6 man-months 
to design and build and contains approximately $2000 worth of parts. A brief description of the NDP system 
is now given.  3.1 Assumptions It is assumed that the graphics display system is a peripheral device 
of a general purpose computer processor. The general purpose processor will handle all mass storage functions, 
input-output functions, and will refresh the graphic display. The general purpose CPU will also monitor 
the usual interactive devices such as a joystick and pot box, data tablet, and keyboard. Light pens are 
not considered as our use has never shown a need for one which could not be handled by a data tablet. 
The interactive devices are attached to the general purpose processor rather than to the graphics system 
for two reasons. First, interfaces of these devices to common processors are com-mercially available. 
Second, these devices oper-ate at slow human rates and therefore can be pro- grammed in a high level 
language supported by the general purpose processor. It is assumed that the CRT-plotter system is used 
in.an interactive mode. That is the user manipu- lates the CRT display until he is satisfied with it. 
He then indicates to the computer system through some device that he would like a hard copy. A copy of 
the CRT display is then plotted. 3.2 The Proposed System within its Environment A block diagram of the 
NDP in its computing en-vironment is shown in fig. 5. Pig. 5 -A block diagram of the NDP in its environment. 
The NDP is connected to the PDP-11/45 by a DEC DRllC general purpose parallel digital inter-face. The 
PUP-11 sends a 16 bit command through the command cable. Only three commands exist: load register, move, 
draw. A load register com-mand instructs the NDP to capture 12 bits of data from the command into one 
of its internal registers (eg. an element of the rotation matrix). A move or draw instruction causes 
the NDP to fetch a co-ordinate triple of drawing data, multiply it times the rotation and translation 
matrix, check the result for rejection, and pass the result to the NDP line generator. If the instruction 
is a move, the line generator updates the CRT beam position without turning on the CRT beam. If the instruc- 
 tion is a draw, the line generator updates the CRT beam position with the CRT beam on. When the com-mand 
is complete, the NDP so indicates to the PDP-11 through the "done" line. PDP-11 software may sense this 
condition and issue a new NDP command. Thus the PDP-11 is actively involved in refreshing the picture. 
The NDP shares PDP-11 core memory. The PDP-11 can write into or read from the memory; the NDP can only 
read from the memory. 64K, 16 bit words of Cambridge dual port memory is presently in use. The memory 
need not necessarily be dual port. If only single port memory were available, both the NDP and the PDP-11 
could share the port through the PDP-11 unibus. Both processors would be some- what slower however, and 
the number of lines which could be displayed without flicker on the CRT would be reduced. The NDP supplies 
a 16 bit word address to memory. Thus, 64K words of drawing data can be accessed by the NDP. No attempt 
is made to access only bytes of data. A 12 bit data word is returned from memory to the NDP. There- fore 
the NDP's initial resolution before any data mapping is one part in 4096. Output from the NDP can be 
sent to a Hewlett-Packard 17" CRT or to a Hewlett-Packard 7210 digital plotter. The NDP must supply analog 
de-flection voltages to the CRT. The plotter and its line generator interface expect digital line end-point 
coordinates. The plotter contains its own line generator to move its pen in straight lines between the 
line endpoints. 3.3 Interesting Characteristics of the NDP In order to keep the NDP as simple as possible, 
all drawing is performed in three dimensions, i.e. three words of data are fetched from core memory for 
each coordinate. Then, after rotation and translation, the Z value is discarded. Thus an orthographic 
projection of a 3D image is always being computed. An alternative, at the cost of more complexity in 
the NDP algorithm, would be to have a 2D or 3D mode of NDP operation. The constant 3D drawing was selected 
for two reasons. First, the 50% increase in the display file size of a 2D drawing should not be excessive 
as computer memory costs continue downward. Second-, the increased complexity of the programming of a 
2D display required by the insertion of an extra word in each display coordinate should be tolerable 
as it only has to be done once. The display of usual 2D images, graphs and waveforms, should be handled 
by a subroutine call from a user's high level language application program. The application programmer 
need not be concerned that the NDP always operates in 3D. Further simplicity in the NDP results from 
definingit as a first quadrant display. The range of coordinates which can be displayed is 0,O through 
2047,2047. It is assumed that this is the range of the drawing data coordinates which are fetched by 
the NDP from core memory. The elements of the rotation and translation matrix may be negative,however. 
The first quadrant assumption allows simplification of the multiplier, the line re-jection logic, the 
line generator digital logic, the D/A converters for the CRT, and the power supply. In addition, since 
the H-P plotter expects first quadrant coordinates, no quadrant mapping need be done before the data 
are sent to the plotter. The loss of resolution to one part in 2048 in the NDP shouldnotbe noticeable 
in the display for two reasons. First, matrix multipli­cation error is not cumulative. Each matrix ele­ment 
is computed, independent of all previous elements, to 16 bits of accuracyby the PDP-11. Second, the D/A 
converters and the remaininganalog circuitry in the CRT and the plotter do not yield accuracy greater 
than one part in 1000. The Evans and Sutherland concept of multiple or repeat or table drawing was 
seriously considered. The table draw instruction,a hardware instruction allowing a series of moves 
or draws using data fetched from a table in memory, is most powerful and some implementationof it should 
be included in the NDP. The table draw instruction is de­ scribed in detail in [5]. One possibility 
is to define efficient assembler languagemacros to re­ duce the table draw to a series of move and draw 
 commands issued by the PDP-11 to the NDP. Another possibility is to implement the instruction in NDP 
hardware. This would require the additionof a counter register, more complicated instruction de­coding, 
and further algorithm states. An estimated time savings of 17% in the execution of a long table draw 
could be had with the hardware imple­mentation. The macro implementationwas selected. Because the NDP 
ignores the Z after rotation of a coordinate triple, no need exists to perform that part of the matrix 
multiplicationwhich computes the rotated Z. The rotation and translation com­ where [X Y Z] is the coordinate 
triple from memory, M is the rotation matrix, [TX Ty] are the trans­ lation terms, and [XRT YRT] is 
the rotated, trans­ lated, and orthographically projected coordinate. Actually the translation terms 
are stored in the bottom row of the matrix. Thus a 4x2 rotation and translation matrix is required. 
 It is assumed that the six rotation elements of the matrix are stored in 12 bit fractional form, that 
is, have a value between -1 and 1. It is also assumed that the coordinate triple is composed of positive 
integers of the range 0 through 2047. The multiplier requires that one of its inputs is an integer and 
the other is a fraction. The pro­duct is an integer. The PDP-11 can easily cal­culate the fractional 
form rotationmatrix ele­ments and pass them to the NDP. A discussion of fractional notation in matrix 
algebra using a PDP­ 11 programmed in Fortran to generate matrix ele­ments is available in [1]. One 
NDP assumption is that any display which might be partially off screen due to rotationor trans­lation 
is composed entirely of short lines. Thus, if either endpoint of a line is off screen and the entire 
line is not drawn, the picture quality is not degraded appreciably. The logic to check for these conditions 
is quite simple, though it is necessary to insure that the NDP algorithm accom­ modates the line rejection 
structure so that no spurious lines are generated for all combinations of moves, draws, line endpoints 
on screen, and line endpoints off screen. Because the NDP is a first quadrant processor which uses 
two's com­ plement arithmetic, if a line endpoint is on the screen, the most significantbit from the 
final translation calculations in X and Y must be zero. If the most significant bit is one, either 
an overflow or a negative result has occurred. An overflow indicates that an endpoint is off screen 
 to the right or to the top. A negative result indicates that an endpoint is off screen to the left 
or to the bottom. Since the entire line is to be rejected, it is not necessary to distinguish in which 
direction the endpoint is off screen. A line is rejected if either the present coordinate or the previous 
coordinate is off screen. If a line is rejected, the savepoint, storing the CRT beam position, is still 
updated from the present coordinate in order that, in the case of a line being rejected because only 
the previous point was off screen, the next line will be drawn from the proper starting point. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

 A PARAMETRIC ALGORITHM FOR DRAWING PICTURES OF SOLID  Joshua Z. Levin, M.S.E.E. New York University 
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Department of Computer Science An algorithm for drawing pictures 
of three-dimensional objects, with surfaces made up of patches of quadric surfaces, isdescribed. The 
emphasis of this algorithm iscalculating the intersections of quadric surfaces. A parameteriza­tion scheme 
isused. Each quadric surface intersection curve (QSIC) is represented as a set of co­ efficients and 
parameter limits. Each value of the parameter represents at most two points, and these may easily be 
distinguished. This scheme can find the co-ordinates of points of even quartic (fourth­ order) intersection 
curves, using equations of no more than second order. Methods of parameterization for each type of QSIC 
are discussed, as well as surface bounding and hidden surface removal.  Permission to make digital

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania A Method for Plotting Curves Defined by Implicit Equations 
 Ephraim Cohen Applicon, Incorporated A square chain of points is found that approximates a plane curve 
of the form F(x,y)=0. In case F(x,y)=0 represents a conic section, the method requires no multiplicationor 
 division, and so is well adapted to hardware or small computer software implementation. The algorithm 
may also be used to find approximate solutions of differential equations of the form Fldx + F2dy = 0. 
 Thus, the graph of a square chain con­tains only right angles, and all the points are pairs of integers. 
Square chains are a restriction of the concept of chains given in [1], where a success­or point may be 
one of eight points, but note that a square chain may be easily converted into a one-of-eight chain by 
removing extraneous corners. Let F(x,y)=0be the implicit equation of some curve in the plane. We will 
approx­imate the curve by a square chain, in the sense that all points of the chain are at most distance 
1 from the curve, provided that we can find one such point by other means. Let (x0 ) be , such a point 
--nearer to the curve than 1. 2. THE ALGORITHM Because a curve defined by an implicit equation has 
no implicit direction, we must first decide in which direction to trace the curve. With F and F the 
partial derivatives of F, the vector (Fx,Fy) is perpendicularto the curve (-Fy,Fx) as the direction 
in which to trace the curve. To trace a curve in the opposite direction, -F may be sub­stituted for F 
in the following. (it is the gradient of F), and so the vectors (-Fy,Fx) and (F,-Fx) are tangent to 
the curve. We arbitrarily choose The curve is traced by incrementing the x-coordinate when on one side 
of the curve and incrementing the y-coordinate when on the other side of the curve, depending om the 
quadrent of the tangent vector at the point in question. Figure 1 shows the action taken in each of the 
eight possible cases. In each case, a new point along the chain is found in terms of the last point 
of the chain, depending on the signs of F and those of the derivatives of F.   263 of F with its 
derivatives at the last known point (x,y) of the chain. The sign of the product (which can be found 
without actually forming the product) determines whether the x or y-coordinate is to be incremented 
to form the next point of the chain. Once this is known, the sign of the increment (whether it is +1 
or -1) may be found from the sign of that coordinate of the tangent vector at (x,y). In case the above 
product is zero, we must deter­mine whether to increment x or y by choosing the longer coordinate of 
the tangent vector at (x,y) as the one to change. Figure 2 is a flowchart of this algorithm.  Fig. 
2 Curve Drawing Flowchart 3. APPLICATION TO CONIC SECTIONS  for some constants a, b, c, d, e, and 
f. The derivatives of F are  We can compute new values of F and its derivatives along the chain in terms 
of previous values of these three functions. For example:  The formulas for the new function values 
at (x-l,y), (x,y+l), and (x,y-1) are sim­ilar. Note that these calculations do not require any multiplicationor 
division, and so conic sections may be traced using no multiplication or division.  4. APPLICATIONTO 
DIFFERENTIALEQUATIONS The solution of a differential equation of the form  is a one-parameter family 
of curves in the plane. A particular solution curve may be determined by choosing a point (x ,y ) and 
requiring the solution to pass through that point. Let F(x,y)=0  be this particular solution. Then 2) 
is parallel to the tangent to F=0. We can use the algorithm to trace the curve F=0 approximately,without 
an explicit formula for F, by using the approximation  to compute new values of F along the chain. We 
know that initially F(x 0 ) is zero because 00) lies on the desired curve. We can use this method to 
draw crude pictures of certain analytic functions quite easily. For example, the curve  may be drawn 
by taking  5. THE COUNTER The algorithm always requires some test to terminate its operation. The 
nature of this test depends on what kind of curve is desired; there is no test that is always applicable. 
In this section, we find the number of iterations needed to draw a straight line and a circular arc. 
 Because the lines in a square chain are all either horizontal or vertical, any square chain joining 
two points (x,y) and (u,v) will have length at least  in the same way that the length of a staircase 
is at least the sum of its height and the horizontal distance it travels. The square chain approximation 
 to a straight line is like a staircase,  264 and so the number of iterations needed to construct the 
chain from (x,y) to (u,v) (equal to the number of line segments required) is just  An arc may be divided 
into a number of monotonically increasing or decreasing pieces, that is, pieces along which the tangent 
to the arc remains in the same quadrent of the plane. The length of the arc-approximatingchain joining 
the end­points of each such piece is the same as the length of the straight-line-approxi­mating chain 
joining these endpoints (they are both the sum of the absolute values of the differences of the coord­inates 
of the endpoints). Thus, a quarter circle of radius r requires 2r iterations to be drawn, and so a whole 
circle of radius r requires 8r iterations. The number of iterations needed for elliptical arcs may be 
found similarly. In particular, the number of iterations required for a whole ellipse is equal to the 
length of the perimeter of the smallest rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides that can be drawn 
around the ellipse.  6. CONCLUSION Because of the density of the points generated by this algorithm, 
it should be most useful for the display of curves on a raster display. However, I have implemented it 
only on an IMLAC (vector­drawing) display, to see if it really worked. It did draw circles and ellipses, 
but the image flickered because the program, taking about sixty microseconds per iteration,was too slow 
to keep up with a refreshed display. REFERENCE [1] H. Freeman Computer Processing of Line Drawing Images,

 HIERARCHICAL GEOMETRIC MODELS FOR VISIBLE-SURFACEALGORITHMS (1) James H. Clark University of California

three­dimensional environments. The thesis of the research isthat the geometric structure inherent in 
the definition of the shapes of three-dimensional objects and environments must be used not just to define

by displaying to him a cliff road or terrain with complicated various visibility situations and permitting

simultaneously cor­recting such costs as are being affected [5]. The first version of ARTES became operational 
in 1972 and has now been used in the design of thousands of kilometers of highways and expressways throughout 
the world. ARTES displays directly on the screen of the interactive unit the graphic components of the: 
-horizontal alignment, see fig. 1, - vertical alignment and natural ground align­ment, see fig. 2, - 
roadway cross-section, see fig. 3, -perspective views in any direction and from any position above or 
on the roadway, see figs. 4 and 5, and calculates the corresponding earthworks quan­tities. Using the 
light pen and keyboards, modifi­cations can be made directly on the screen, for example, to the horizontal 
or vertical alignments. The effects of these modifications are available for display immediately including 
perspectives and corrections in earthworks quantities. Fig. 1 ---This is a display of a typical horizontal 
alignment. An area was selected directly on the screen, where this horizontal alignment could be modified. 
Passage corridors were also identified on the display unit. The program then attempts to identify the 
most smoothed alternative possible, while respecting the imposed geometric con­ straints and the passage 
corridors. Fig. 2 -This is a typical vertical alignment. The functional keys control the displacement, 
modifi­cations in scale and supervision of geometric con­straints of slope and curve. The basic points 
of the vertical alignment can be seen. These points can be detected by the light pen and displaced by 
feeding into the typewriter the differences of curvi­linear abscissa and of the DX and DY coordinates. 
 Fig. 3 -This is a typical cross-section. The dif­ ferent factors of the cross-sections can be modi­ 
fied, either directly (the scale, for example) or on a similar picture, such as creating complicated 
embankments with walls. By displacing the center line of the alignment, difficult construction prob-. 
lems (cliffs, railway tracks, etc. ) can be exam­ined on the screen. 269 Fig. 4 -A perspective is shown 
on the screen. An option can be made (such as continuing to the next perspective) by using the light 
pen. On the right can be seen the typewriter keyboard and on the left the functional key panel. computation 
data, visibility distances and align­ment loss. Calculation options can also be di­rectly modified by 
the light pen and by feeding new values into the typewriter. A particular option enables the perspective 
to be drawn directly. An explanation is called for here: the initial cen­ter lines and vertical alignments 
may possibly have been calculated by the traditional geometric components method and it is exceedingly 
difficult to make modifications which directly use such geometric components. ARTES, therefore, per­mits 
the designer to directly modify certain align­ment points, also called base points, which are all connected 
by polynomial curves, in order to provide the necessary continuity and verify the geometrical constraints 
[6]. This procedure is applicable to vertical alignments without restric­tion and the line thus obtained 
can be considered as final. The same does not hold true for hori­zontal alignments. Even though the resulting 
curve verifies the necessary geometrical condi­tions, it cannot always be directly used for the final 
location if the roadway is for high design speeds. However, in this case, since the geo­metrical conditions 
are met, calculating a conven­tional alignment with only a slight deviation (a few decimeters) is straightforward. 
The earthworks quantities calculated and the visibility conditions developed may be considered as valid, 
however, in view of the high degree of accuracy in the data and calculated results encountered at this 
point. 3. PROGRAM DATA Input data concerning the center line and vertical alignment may be the result 
of direct definition by basic points, or on the other hand, by the conven­tional calculation method. 
In this latter case, it is possible to arrive at an actual integration of the center line and vertical 
alignment as previously computed. Natural ground data can also be obtained in vari­ous ways from either 
a complete cross-section or from a simplified cross-section (one point and two transversal slopes, or 
in some cases, by a single point on the center line). Basic cross-section data are supplied as standard 
cross-sections in the library along with standard transitional zone options. This flexibility allowed 
in the manner the input data can be prepared and the resulting compati­bility this provides with other 
design programs is important. The ARTES program is, for example, entirely compatible with the French 
SETRA Sys­tem and indications are that it could and should be made compatible with other systems of this 
type such as the Federal Highway Administration s Road Design System. The various features of the ARTES 
program and its great flexibility make it a convenient and useful instrument in a wide var­iety of fields. 
Examples are given below. 4. CHECKING THE VISIBILITY OF A PRELIMINARY DESIGN A preliminary design based 
only on the following graphic elements: -horizontal alignment, - vertical alignment and natural ground 
alignment, and -standard cross section can be visualized completely within a very short time. Within 
only ten days, the Northern France Agency of SETRA was able to thoroughly check the visibility conditions 
of the entire 110 km of a given section of the A 26 expressway, to determine the main disadvantages of 
the alignment as well as indi­cate desirable improvements and their correspond­ing costs, all for a total 
machine cost of $2,000.  5. DIRECT STUDY OF CERTAIN ALIGNMENTS When only brief studies of short alignments 
are needed, such as computing earthworks quantities depending on the type of crossing structures used, 
the horizontal and vertical alignments can then be directlyinput and shown on the screen, along with 
the natural ground definition. Numerous different alternatives can then be analyzed in sequence within 
a relatively short time. For example, figs. 6 through 8 demonstrate such a sequence. Fig. 6 displays 
a poor visibility condition bordering on sight discontinuity. Fig. 7 shows a first attempt to correct 
the condition and some improvement. Fig. 8 shows a fully corrected alignment with near perfect visibility. 
Fig. 7 -A first attempt to correct the condition showing some improvement. Fig. 6 -A poor visibility 
condition bordering on sight discontinuity. Fig. 8 -A fully corrected alignment with near 271 perfect 
visibility.  6. CONNECTION WITH AN OPTIMIZATION STUDY As implied above, this was the main objective 
in developing ARTES. The vertical alignment gene- rated by the optimization program can now be checked 
from a visibility standpoint and can be corrected directly on the screen. This almost inevitably results 
in a compromise choice being made by the designer between the extent that driver visibility can be improved 
versus the quantities of earthworks affected. The object, of course, is to provide the maximum of driver 
safety for a minimum of Cost. This was preciselywhat was done in the study of the RN 4 highwaydetour 
in easternFrance referred to as the deviation de Stainville. The cost of the initial un-optimized solution 
amounted to $3. 1 million. By using the APPOLON computer optimization pro-gram, the cost was reduced 
to $2.6million, but a considerable visual loss of alignment occurred and slight other imperfections were 
noticed. These both were detected and corrected in a highly satisfactory manner directlyon the graphic 
console using ARTES. In SO doing the cost increased to $2.8 million. This, of course, reduced the optimized 
savings by about $200,000 to improve the visibility situation to a satisfactory level and left a $300,000 
saving over the originalunoptimized alignment. A series of console displays generated by ARTES for the 
design team during this project is shown in figs. 9 through 17. Fig. 10 -The display produced as a result 
of a request for a cross-sectional view of the vertical alignment. Fig. 9 -The initial display setting 
parameters for the redesign of route RN 4 at Stainville in eastern France. Fig. 1 f -A request for cross 
section calculations. Fig. 14 - the same view (as fig. 13) except at 1700 meters. Fig. 15 - The same 
view (as figs. 13 and 14) local- izing the problem at 1800 meters and clearly indi- cating a very poor 
and dangerous visibility condition.  The computer and other costs involved amounted to $1,200 or about 
1/250 of the anticipated invest­ments benefit. In making an overall estimate of the advantages presented 
by ARTES, considera­tion must also be given to the costs and time that would have been involved in correcting 
the visi­bility deficiencies in the normal manner. 7. CONCLUSION The above brief description of ARTES 
has focused attention to the possibilities offered by being able to visualize and modify the results 
of optimization. ARTES has been operational, in a production sense, since 1972 and has since been further 
re­fined. The advantages have considerably out­weighed the expenses involved, but it must be kept in 
mind that ARTES is a tool and a tool only, and must remain under the control of the designer re­sponsible 
for analysis, options and trade-offs making up the final configuration of the roadway. As a matter of 
fact, having ARTES available to him increases his responsibility because he is relieved from a number 
of tedious tasks and to a certain extent from time pressures. Thus, he can and therefore must examine 
more attentively all the factors involved and carefully review the con­sequences of his choices before 
making his final decisions. REFERENCES [1] P. Antoniotti and P. Olalainty, Computer and optimization

76, July 14-16 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania COMPUTER AIDED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN - A DISTRIBUTED INTEGRATED 
APPROACH E. B. Kozemchak Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated Allentown, Pa. 18103 The design 
of silicon integrated circuits requires a broad spectrum of computer aids for simulation, physical design, 
and testing. A CAD approach is described which is both integrated and distributed in nature. The various 
functions required by circuit designers for simulation, layout, and testing are integrated into a single 
system, based on a minicomputer (HP21MX) with a storage scope (Tektronix4014) display. These systems 
are distributed to provide the design aids in close proximity to users. Approximatelyforty systems 
are now employed for the various steps in the design process. 1. INTRODUCTION The design process for 
integrated circuits (ICs) is complex. It requires many talents-includingunderstanding of semi­ conductor 
devices, circuit design, logic design, circuit simulation, layout of complex mask sets, generation 
of test programs, testing, test data reduction, specification of the design for manu­ facture, and 
troubleshootingdesign and manufacturingproblems. The most impor­ tant asset in successfully accomplishing 
 this design function is a group of indi­ viduals with the design experience and engineering judgment 
to make good deci­ sions at each step in this process. While this human resource is a necessary condition, 
the complexity of integrated circuit design has rendered the human resource alone insufficient. The 
 integrated circuit designer must rely heavily on computer aids to deal with the sheer magnitude of 
the problem at each step. While reliance on computer aids is essential, we are still far from the point 
where the computer, devoid of real human engineering judgment, can design an inte­grated circuit. We 
are at the point where the proper use of computer aids in basically an interactivemode at each step in 
the process can lead to significant reductions in design time, cost, and probability of error. A simplified 
overview of the steps in­volved in the design of an IC is shown in fig. 1. Each box represents a major 
function to be performed, a major soft­ware system to aid in that step, and an interface between the 
designer and the computer. The chart is simplified not so much because it leaves out steps, but because 
it fails to show the heavy inter­action that goes on between the various steps. For example, the way 
in which a circuit is to be tested may affect how it is physically designed, or the physical design 
of the circuit may introduce changes in the DC or transient behavior.  This paper will attempt to take 
the design environment just described and present an approach to computer-aideddesign which has worked 
well within that environment. The design system will be described by attempting to answer the following 
questions: 1. What are the key elements of a costeffective CAD system? 2. What are the key elements 
of this system from the user s vantage point? 3. What are the key elements of the system from the software 
developer s point of view? 4. How can the user s and developer s needs best be met in an environment 
of continually evolving and changingneeds?  2. COST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM The key to cost effectiveness is 
matchingthe computer system used to the need athand, A computer that is too powerful or not powerful 
enough for the task involved will lead to ineffective utilization of both people and machines. In consideringthe 
needs of an IC design system, thefollowing attributes were considered mostimportant: 1. IC design involves 
the processing of many designs which can generally betreated independently of each other. 2. IC design 
is typically organizedaround several product lines, e.g. memory,bipolar logic, MOS logic, etc.The need 
for common project libraries is, therefore, important, but there isno need for sharing of these librariesbetween 
project groups by establishing one central data base. 3. Various project groups should remain compatible 
with others where this compatibility does not needlessly  compromise their effectiveness.Design aids 
in support of specificproduct lines should be undertaken, bysoftware development teams working closely 
with those product lines when a sufficient design volume is antici­pated to offset software development 
costs. 4. The core of general purpose design aids should be technology independent and should be adaptable 
to increasingcomplexity. Integrated circuits haveprogressed from simple gates to 16K memories on a single 
silicon chip inless than a decade. These considerations led to the choice of a minicomputer-based interactive 
design system. The independence between designsled to the conclusion that no one central data base for 
a large number of designs had to be maintained. This recognition made possible the establishment of many 
indepen­dently operated design systems, with no ties between them other than a magnetic tape interface. 
The need for common libraries within product lines has been handled by project libraries, stored onmagnetic 
tape. A specific design is then initiated by extracting the necessaryinformation from the library tape 
onto a job tape and proceeding. The key to main­taining compatibility between project groups has been 
standardization on a single minicomputer hardware configuration and standardization at key interfaces, 
such as a standard graphic description languageand a standard logical connectivitylanguage. The minicomputer 
chosen was an HP21MX with 16K of memory, a SM-byte disk, and a 9­track magnetic tape drive. This system,together 
with an optional digitizerplotter! is shown in fig. 2. User inter­action is via a Tektronix 4014 storage 
 scope display, alphanumeric and command Distributed Approach keyboards, and thumbwheel-controlled crosshairs. 
The basic system can be purchased for approximately $50K and yields an on-line usage charge of approxi­mately 
$6 per hour over standard working hours. The evolution of minicomputer computing power and cost has been 
well matched to the evolving needs of IC design. A typical graphical data base for an LSI chip is 600K 
bytes-still well within the minicomputer mass storage range.  3. USER NEEDS Integrated Approach The 
steps in fig. 1 give some indication of the number of different functions for which a CAD system is 
used. At the present time, all functions shown in fig. 1 that are amenable to computer aids have been 
used effectively on the mini­computer. It is, therefore, possible to provide these functions in one integrated 
design system, resident on the mini­ computer. This approach eliminates the need for multiple computer 
systems to perform different parts of the job. All frequently-used designtools are made available on 
the HP21MX standard hardware configuration. These tools include inter­active graphics, automatic layout 
aids, design rule checking, tape output for plotters and mask making equipment, circuit analysis, logic 
simulation, test program preparation aids, and data analysis programs. The uniqueness of this approach 
is due largely to the breadth of functions that have been integrated into one minicomputer system. Users 
need interact with only this system. A typical silicon integrated circuit designed with this system is 
shown in fig. 3.  To make effective use of this integrated system, it must be distributed among users. 
Forty systems are presently in use in Bell Laboratories and Western Electric at four locations. At each 
location, these systems are dispersed geographicallyin order to provide the distributed processing power 
in close proximity to those using it. If one system is down, others can pick up the load. Priorities 
can be established by those close to the work needs.  4. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS From the diversity 
of aids available on the minicomputer design system, it is clear that software development must proceed 
with well established ground rules. While interactive graphics is usually given a large amount of attention 
in computer-aideddesign literature, it accounts for less than 50% of the total design aids software. 
Development of this software centers around several major sub­systems. Each subsystem has a separate 
data base. Portions of the data base are shared between subsystems. Interfacing between subsystems when 
required is done in standardized interface languages. The major subsystems and their related data bases 
are: (1) Layout Graphic file  (2) Logic simula. Gate connectivity  (3) Circuit anal. Transistor connectivity 
 (4) Test program Tester instructions preparation  (5) Test data anal.Tester output  (6) Text editing 
Text file  While some overlap exists between data bases, they can be treated independently for the 
most part. Thus, the software development effort for each subsystem can proceed in a reasonably independent 
way from the other subsystems. The interaction between graphics-related software and test data reduction 
is virtually nonexistent. On the other hand, where functions proceed from a common circuit schematic 
or circuit description language, these functions share circuit connectivity descriptions. Thus, for 
example, the same data base is used to execute a logic simulator and to prompt the graphics system user 
with connectivity information. The real key in maintaining a workable integrated system is to have well-defined 
interfaces between various subsystems and between the subsystems and the user. Some examples of these 
include the standardized graphic description language, the logical connectivity description, an expanded 
vector file for interfacing the graphics system to various plotters and other post layout functions, 
a standard test language format, or a standard tester output description. 277 Having separated the 
job into the develop­ment of several independent subsystems, software for each subsystem can proceed 
to best meet the particular need. Options available to the software developer include use of standard 
vendor-supplied operating systems or special-purpose, low­overhead operating systems tailored to the 
specific job. Source code may be written in assembly language or higher-level languages such as FORTRAN. 
Both approaches have been taken in the IC design system in terms of operating systems and programming 
languages. Thus, a system user may perform a layout using software with a tailored operating system 
and assembly language code. Having completed a layout session, he dumps his output onto magnetic tape. 
At this point, a user of the logic simulator or text editor may load a magnetic tape and begin his work. 
These systems are available under the same tailored operating system. Having completed a logic simulation 
and dumped the results onto magnetic tape, that user might leave and a third user of the data analysis 
or circuit analysis programs may access the system. Since these programs are written in FORTRAN and operate 
under a standard disk operating system, a 30-second change of disk platters is required to access the 
new software. For most applications, the minicomputer has proved to be well matched to the needs of 
IC design. In terms of processor speed, the only significant limitationhas been in tasks requiring large 
amounts of floating point arithmetic computation, such as circuit analysis. Here the com­parative slowness 
of minicomputer floating point hardware has limited circuit size for interactively executed jobs. In 
terms of mass storage, data analysis programs have been the only area to really push the 5 megabyte capacity. 
Here it is possible for test data from a single IC wafer to fill up the entire disk. With these few exceptions, 
the minicomputer has provided the necessary computational power. There are roughly 40 man-years invested 
in the software system. Of this, approximate­ly 20 man-years involve layout (graphics) related software, 
5 involve simulation aids, and 15 involve testing aids. This software has been developed by approximate­ly 
10 people over a four-year period. 5. INTERFACE BETWEEN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND USER COMMUNITIES No 
system of this magnitude could be effectively built without an extremely close working relationship between 
the developers and users of the software. Major new programs are instituted only after a careful evaluation 
of where design time, manpower, and cost are spent, and an estimate of what the impact of computer 
aids in that function might be. At this point, input from users is solicited for two reasons. First, 
it provides a good measure of what the real needs are-some­thing that software development people cannot 
otherwise determine. Secondly, it gives the users a sense of contributing to the design aids system. 
This joint commitment is extremely beneficial in the early stages of system use. Most of the software 
involved is technology independent. Various product lines, however, impose unique needs on the system, 
and these needs invariably change with time. To keep pace with evolving needs and to provide a long term 
user-developer dialogue, user groups have been estab­lished. These groups meet at specified intervals 
to review new requirements and shape software development by rank order­ing the importance of suggested 
new features.  6. SUMMARY An interactive, minicomputer-basedsystem with-wide ranging capabilities 
for integrated circuit design has been described. The uniqueness of the system is the breadth of functions 
it makes available in an integrated way. While many minicomputer-basedsystems provide sohpisticated interactive 
graphics, few, if any, provide the broad scope of aids necessary for integrated circuit design. 278

 MAKING GRAPHICS WORK Jerry J. LAVICK Manager, Systems Programming (CAD/CAM) McDonnell Douglas Automation 
Company (MCAUTO) St. Louis, Missouri ABSTRACT This paper describes some of the operational considerations 
of a large data processing installation involved in support of an interactive computer system in heavy 
production use. Application and operating system software has varied over the continued growth and expansionof 
this system. Mechanisms for user input and feedback, vital aspects to its successful operation, are discussed. 
The application specific­ ally cited is MCDONNELL DOUGLAS' CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided-Design/Computer-Aided-Manufacturing) 
System and highlighted are daily operations of its computer graphics terminals. This system is configured 
to provide 95% availability with backup switchability fea­tures. Typical response, varying with the nature 
of the user application, ranges from 0.1 to 60 seconds. INTRODUCTION DATA PROCESSING ORGANIZATION AND

GRAPHICS HISTORY: Graphics capability and utilization at MDC have been evolu­tionary, commencing with 
the first in-house CG configuration implementation using an IBM 2250 CRT and 360/40 computer in May 1966. 
Figure (2) briefly summarizes system software evolution milestone changes along with console growth. 
Graphics accomplishments, a subset of total CAD/CAM System develop­ments as denoted in Figure (3), goes 
back much beyond the in­stallation of our first in-house console in 1966. It is also apparent from analysis 
of these time graphs that operating system and hardware (Figure 2) and application software (Figure 3) 
devel­opment and capability has progressed through the years. The May 1976 graphics configuration, illustrated 
in Figure (4), highlights specific console designations, different remoting tech­niques employed, use 
of three distinct host computers for com­plete CG operations and central graphics data base activities. 
As previously mentioned, the remainder of this paper will not dwell on specific applications of computer 
graphics, but will highlight the day-to-day activities involved in the successful operation of "making 
graphics work". The reader, if interested in further application discussion of MDC's graphics programs, 
is referred to [ 1, 2, 3] publications. Also, details of typical mathematics employed by these applications 
are well covered in the [4, 5] literature. OPERATIONAL GROWTH/STABILITY: As previously indicated, MCAUTO 
configurations are in heavy production usage by a variety of applications. Managing this large and complex 
installation demands technical know how and extensive managerial talent on the part of various levels 
of data processing executives. There are many ways to measure the re­sults obtained from implementing 
a set of policies and techniques for improving installation management methods. One particular­ly significant 
test of success is whether operational stability can be maintained during periods of rapid growth in 
hardware and software systems. In 1971, when it was perceived that rapidly increasing complexity called 
for new approaches to installation management at MCAUTO, total CPU "power" in the St. Louis installation 
in terms of equivalent System/360 Model 195s was approximately 1.75. The ASP systems were processing 
an average of 39,000 jobs per month, calling for nearly 52,000 tape mounts and 16,000 disk mounts. The 
IMS and graphics systems were in an early phase of implementation and had only limited usage. During 
this period unscheduled system restarts (IPLs) averaged 22 per system per month. By mid 1975 CPU "power" 
had been increased 1-17% and the number of ASP jobs was 78,000, tapes mounts 122,000, and disk mounts 
over 30,000 per month. In addition, two IMS systems were processing almost 600,000 transactions each 
day and the graphics system was supporting fifteen 2250 display units, two shifts per day, six days per 
week. By this time the unscheduled IPLs had been reduced to an average of 6.7 per system per month. During 
this period there had been overall software and hardware technology improvements, but these improvements 
were not as significant as the greatly increased exposures resulting from fast growth, greater complexity 
of interconnected systems, massive installation rearrangements, and hugh on-line systems. Those factors 
are what make the re­sults cited above important, because they mean a foundation has been established 
for continued growth. COMMUNICATIONS, THE KEY: The factor that is most influential in effecting MCAUTO's 
successful operation of the previously described configura­tions, is the communication flow, both upward, 
downward, and through DP and user organizations. MCAUTO manage­ment has set an availability target of 
96-98% -a formidable challenge in view of the installation's complexity. A series of scheduled, structured 
planning and review meetings has been a key factor in meeting this challenge, and the desired target 
is seldom missed. Both operations and programming management people, from supervisors to the vice president 
of computer serv­ices, are involved in daily, weekly, biweekly, and triweekly re­view and planning meetings 
as illustrated in Figure (5). Although all MCAUTO DP matters are covered in these meetings, graphics 
is in continual address and given high priority treatment due to its magnitude and MDC importance. 280 
The result is that management is well informed and respondsquickly to problems, and also that most problems 
are avoided and those that do occur are resolved with minimal impact on productivity. Non-regularly scheduied 
meetings, such as the RESPONSE/LOCKOUT TASK FORCE, are formed on an ad hoc basis and are extremely important 
in consolidating an over­view of all factors and their interrelationships to graphic response. Beginning 
in 1971 in response to outstanding problems, the re­view and planning meetings have since undergone many 
changes.At first they were attended by members of top management responding to crises; today they bring 
together a cross section of functional departments and management levels. FIGURE 2 MDC-STL: CONSOLE 
GROWTH AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE EVOLUTION  FIGURE 3 MDC-STL: CAD/CAM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 281 FIGURE 
4 MDC-STL: MAY 1976 GRAPHICS CONFIGURATION Daily Meetings -Possibly the most crucial meeting, from the 
operations viewpoint, is the planning meeting held each morn­ing, chaired by the technical coordinator 
from operations and attended by operations supervisors and first-level managers from various operating 
and programming areas. They evaluate the previous day's operations, diagnose any equipment or software 
problems that have occurred, suggest solutions, and plan the schedule for all activities for the new 
day or the weekend. One form of input to this session from the graphics community is the user's log. 
Figure (6) is a general user log sample and Figure (7) is one that is more project-oriented. By correlating 
precise time period of log entries, the planning group can correspond­ingly determine trouble sources. 
Comment notes on these fig­ures are typical of input feedback from the graphics user. In order to direct 
the decision making process, firm prioritized guidelines have been established for this group to function 
as follows: (1) fix system bugs, (2) implement planned hardware with its associated task, (3) improve 
user response, (4) improve total system performance, and (5) accommodate general en­hancements. At 1:30 
PM the vice president of computer serv­ ices meets with the directors of operations and systems pro­gramming 
to review the new operating plan as well as the 282 status of unresolved problems. Immediately after 
this meeting, the new operating plan for the next immediate day and for weekend period is distributed 
and put into effect. Weekly Meetings -Hardly a week goes by in which no equip­ment change occurs; e.g., 
you don't bring graphics work to a fixed console location. The operating philosophy that best "makes 
graphics pay" is to place the terminal wherever the project is located. This may also mean following 
the peak phases of activity as they move from advanced design, detail design, and manufacturing. MCAUTO's 
operations, programming, and facilities personnel meet weekly with hardware/software vendors to plan 
activities for the coming weekend, and perhaps for the following one. This may not only be relative to 
new graphic consoles, but perhaps the addition of on-line disk packs in support of increased or new project 
users. To maintain normal production, changes, whether to add or replace equipment, move devices, or 
install an engineering change, are made during regularly scheduled maintenance that takes place on Sunday. 
Changes recommended for inclusion in the weekend schedule are reviewed by operations managers, who also 
meet weekly. Reliability, as indicated by summaries of systems performance, engineering changes, and 
equipment installations are all care­fully reviewed. Changes approved for inclusion in the weekend plan 
are then submitted during the Friday morning planning meeting. Biweekly Meetings -Strategic and tactical 
planning for long­range equipment changes is done in biweekly meetings of operations, facilities, technical 
services, and hardware vendor marketing people. These meetings involve reviews of the current backlog 
(on-order equipment), evaluation of business trends and new product announcements, and determination 
of short term needs to facilitate migration to new components. Planning for a new application or a major 
change, such as a new version of GSP (Graphics Support Package) or the installation of a new CPU, is 
handled by ad hoc committees. Members of these committees are selected in a way that provides broad representation 
of all affected areas. Depending on the scope of the assignment, meetings are scheduled as needed. Triweekly 
Meetings -This meeting organized and chaired by Systems Programming (CAD/CAM), is attended by pertinent 
MCAUTO departments and CG user representatives from the McDonnell Aircraft and Astronautics Companies. 
Problems, if there are any, and plans for new requirements are dealt with; also suggestions may be given 
to programming or operations for their consideration and response. Figure (8) illustrates the plan­ning 
document used to monitor all pertinent new CAD/CAM FIGURE 5 activities and discussed at each session

7 COMPUTER GRAPHIC CONSOLE USER LOG CADD Project Oriented Response Lockout Task Force -This ad hoc group, 
also chaired by Systems Programming (CAD/CAM), is activated, as required, in the continuing interest 
of achieving and maintaining satis­factory response and reliable graphics performance. In consoli­ dating 
all sources of potential impact to daily graphics opera­ tions, task force members address such areas 
as operating system software and priority, application software, on-line data base contention, user errors, 
CPU utilization, all I/O device usage, etc. As an example of the many facets involving graphics re­sponse, 
at this writing, nineteen isolated areas affecting system performance are being actively addressed by 
this group. Typifying the importance of communication, Figure (9) de­scribes MCAUTO's central operation 
station where operations is in constant contact with the on-line graphics users. Hotline phones are positioned 
at all user terminals. A close-up of the cabinet behind the operator, denoted in Figure (10), illustrates 
the availability of several communication tools: (a) reset devices for remotely located display buffer 
control units, (b) phone answering/recording devices, and (c) individual CG terminal status indicator 
switches. A procedure involving ON, OFF, or BLINK has been established enabling operations to communi­cate 
to all and/or each remote user site via these switches. This can be noted in Figure (11) by the alert 
lights positioned to the upper left position of the screen. Another useful item employ­ed by operations 
is the use of portable cassette recorders to provide additional information and observations about condi­ 
tions at the time of a system incident. Talking is far easier than writing, and takes less time, so operators 
are more likely to provide complete descriptions. Morever, operators can justifi­ably feel that they 
have helped solve the problem, because their tapes are used in the daily review and planning meetings. 
 the effective teamwork process and the resultant be nefits. These meetings are highly oriented to problem 
solving rather than to "finger-pointing." Increased interdepartmental communication in planning and implementation 
has successfully overcome the usual parochial attitude of people representing particular dis­ciplines. 
A spirit of mutual cooperation exists, which leads to a willingness to assume responsibility, an ability 
to compromise, and an understanding of the diverse but highly interdependent functions represented. Computer 
systems cannot of themselves produce the desired quality of computer service, but joint ef­forts in developing 
plans and controlling the installation activity have helped management achieve this goal. Among the benefits 
resulting from these efforts are: (a) Sustained high level of service to users; (b) Accelerated problem 
solving; (c) Enhanced management effectiveness; and (d) Growth combined with operational stability. RESULTS 
Ten years ago, heavy production CG usage was practically a dream. Today we have moved far beyond this 
point to a posi­tion of reality, where large scale systems are in place heavily committed to graphics 
and other DP functions. The question therein is "how to cope with and timely resolve problems in­herent 
is systems of such complexity?", or in the specific case of CG, "how to make graphics work"? The preceeding 
sections of this paper have attempted to relate MCAUTO philosophy and approach in addressing these issues 
through implementation of people oriented and regularly structured meeting-oriented solutions. The significance 
of the meetings at MCAUTO lies in 284 DATE 6 March 1976 CAD/CAM PROBLEM REQUEST LOG CF 217 10 Sep 74)

management is to minimize the risk by anticipatingand planning for foreseeable problems, and having alternate 
or backup plans for those that cannot be predicted. MCAUTO management accomplishes this by a regular 
investment of man­agement time in review and planning meetings. The return on this investment is obvious 
in the degree of control achieved, the reduction in the number and severity of system incidents, and 
the steady growth of the installation in which all applica­tions, such as graphics, can achieve their 
full potential. By meet­ing these issues head on, MCAUTO demonstrates the highly important role the DP 
organization has in making graphics work . 286

			<par><![CDATA[A computer program, the Line Drawing Editor (LDE), that allows convenient modification of computer representations of simple line drawings has been designed and implemented. The distinguishing feature of the LDE from the multitude of interactive graphics programs that accomplish the same function is the use of a computer controlled TV camera for input and program control rather than conventional interactive input devices such as light pens or data tablets.

 THE LINE DRAWING EDITOR, AN EXPERIMENT IN COMPUTER VISION John F. Jarvis 4E610 Bell Laboratories Holmdel, 
New Jersey 07733 A computer program, the Line Drawing Editor (LDE), that allows convenient modification 
of computer representationsof simple line drawings has been designed and implemented. The distinguishing 
feature of the LDE from the multitude of interactive graphics programs that accomplish the same function 
is the use of a computer controlled TV camera for input and program control rather than conventional 
interactive input devices such as light pens or data tablets. A graphical editing language allows the 
LDE user to indicate, by marking the drawing in appropriate fashion, the changes that are to be made. 
The drawing, which was generated on a hardcopy output device, with the added edit information is placed 
in front of the camera. In successive phases the LDE computes a two dimensional homogeneous transformation 
relating the viewed drawing and its computer description, locates the lines added to the drawing, parses 
the added lines according to the edit language and finally uses this information to update the drawing 
description. The Line Drawing Editor (LDE) is a computer pro­gram designed to allow creation and modification 
of computer representationsof line drawings. The distinguishingfeature of the LDE from the multi­tude 
of interactive graphics programs that accomplish the same functions is the use of a computer controlled 
TV camera for input and pro­gram control rather than conventional interactive graphics input devices 
such as light pens or data tablets. Perhaps the earliest example of such conventional interactive graphics 
program is Sutherland's SKETCHPAD[1]. Schematic diagrams representing logic circuits have been used as 
the particular drawing type processed by the LDE since specializationto a specific drawing category appears 
necessary to provide a drawing syntax for many of the processes to be described in subsequent sections 
of this paper. Without such a syntax only very limited results could have been achieved. The LDE is 
used by marking,with a graphical editing language, the desired changes on a drawing previously generated 
from its computer description. After all desired changes have been marked on the drawing it is placed 
in front of the camera and the LDE program is started. In successivephases the LDE then computes a two 
dimensional homogeneous trans­ form relating the viewed drawing with its computer description, finds 
all lines added to the drawing, parses these added lines into the allowed editing operations and finally 
updates the drawing description data base. The edit functions provided in the LDE have been modeled after 
similar facilities available in interactive graphics programs and include move, copy, delete, addition 
of lines and addition of drawing symbols by name from a predefined library. Permission to make digital 
or hard copies of part or all of this work or personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Motivation for this project has come observing that users of existing interactive 
graphics facili­ ties carefully plan their work sessions and appropriatelymark a copy of the drawing 
before actually using the interactive graphics system. This preplanning serves to minimize the time 
spent at the interactive graphics console. This project represents a formalization of this preplanning 
 into a language that can be read and interpretted by both the system users and a computer program, 
 the LDE. The implementationof the above ideas as a compu­ ter program was designed primarily to demonstrate 
 a concept rather than as an attempt to produce a working design aids system suitable for drafting room 
usage. Proving the soundness of or searching for serious flaws in a concept allows considerable simplification 
of the implementationeffort relative to what is needed to build a functioning production system. The 
first major restriction is the limitation of both the class of drawings processed by the system and the 
graphical edit language entities to those that can be constructed from variable length straight lines 
of four orientations, that is slopes of 0, a, and ±1. The second major restriction is that no processing 
of textual information, which forms an important part of actual schematic diagrams, is attempted. Successfully 
dealingwith textual information with an LDE like program will be much more difficult than handling 
arbitrary line orienta­ tions and curves. A good example of an inter­ active graphics program for the 
maintenance of schematic drawings in a production environment is the LOGIGRAF program of Mancusi and 
Wild[2]. Very approximately,one half of the schematic drawing data base is devoted to the storage of 
textual information in this system. The processing steps used to find and interpret lines according 
to the edit language are analogous to the steps in compiling a textual computer language; i.e., one written 
with an alphabet of alphanumeric characters. However, in the LDE the added lines, "characters", must 
first be found, a step which is completely trivial in processing textual languages. After the added lines 
are found, (a step paralleled by the lexical analysis phase of processing a textual language) they are 
 assembled into commands in a procedure analogous to parsing. The final processing operation is to modify 
the drawing description according to the edit commands, a function analogous to program execution in 
the textual language simile. The host computer system for this project is a large DEC PDP-11/45 which 
includes a cache memory, demountable disks, industry compatible 9-track magnetic tape and a floating 
point processor. The system operates under control of the BTL developed UNIX timesharing system[3]. The 
most important restriction imposed on the LDE by this system is the limitation of core resident program 
and data to 64K (1K=1024) bytes. A PDP-11/20 is attached as a peripheral to the 11/45 and serves as 
a con­troller for graphical displays and a camera. A description of the display system which incorpor­ 
ates Owens-Illinois512-60 plasma panels is given in [4]. The camera is a EMR 659D Optical Data Digitizer[5]. 
The LDE requires hardcopy produced from drawings described in a data base in the 11/45 file system. These 
are produced on a FR80 microfilm recorderwhich is driven from a magnetic tape. An existing drawing 
representationtechnique, the Area Organized Data Base[6] is used for maintainingdrawing descriptions. 
Use of the system enables the use of small incore buffers while existing programs provide for drawing 
entry and production of drawings on the local displays and the FR80 microfilmrecorder. Entry is done 
using a simple hierarchic description language with the atomic or primitive features being lines, rectangles 
and points. These primitives are supplemented by a symbol facilitythat allows named collections of the 
primitives to be manipu­ lated in much the same way the basic constructs are. The purpose of the edit 
language is to specify to the LDE desired changes to be made to the drawing. In analogy with interactive 
graphics approachesto such editing, a fundamental set of edit operationsmust include the functions 
of MOVE, COPY, DELETE and ADDition of lines and drawing symbols. Rotation and reflection oper­ ations 
are also fundamental interactive graphics functions but have not been included in the LDE at this time 
due to problem of perceiving the results of these operations. An edit operation consists of a set of 
lines, the edit command, which specify the desired operation and other information needed to indicate 
what is to be modified and where it is to go. The additional edit commands include the POSITIONERwhich 
is used to place items being moved or copied, a BREAK com­ mand to limit the extent of line editing 
and a GROUPing mechanism needed when an edit operation is to manipulated more than one symbol or line. 
 Addition of symbols is done with the ADD command, which also requires the DIGITS 0-9 to indicate which 
symbolis to be added. One specific symbol, the solder dot (SDOT), is used to indicate that crossinglines 
are to be considered as connected. The solder dot is used often enough to justify a separate edit command 
for it. Addition of new lines to the drawing is accomplishedwhen the added lines cannot be interpreted 
in terms of the edit language. In the above description capitalized words correspond to the names of 
the edit commands that have been provided in the LDE. Figure 1 shows the set of edit commands which 
were designed to satisfy the requirements listed above. With the exception of the DIGITs, the language 
design allows all commands to be drawn in four possible orientations. In additionto these, an arbitrary 
size rectangle is used for the GROUP command. The GROUP command is the only one not subjected to a maximum 
size restriction. Examples of valid edit operations constructed ac­cording to these rules are given 
in Figure 2. The meanings of the four constructs given in this figure are as follows: A) A symbol, type 
14, oriented vertically is placed at the location of the ADD symbol. B) The symbol and two lines enclosed 
by the GROUP are copied and moved. Only a vertical translation is made and it corresponds to the distance 
between the edge of the GROUP intersected by the COPY command and the long arm of the POSITIONER. C) 
A line segment delimited by the two BREAK symbols is deleted and replaced by the three line segments 
forming a "U". The "U" is not interpreted as a copy as it is not syntacticallycorrect as a copy operation. 
D) A drawing symbol, in this case a simple rectangle, is moved upwards and to the right. This list 
is in no way exhaustive and is only meant to indicate some of the operationspossible with the language. 
 Another important aspect of the language definition consists of specifyingthe execution order of the 
 set of edit operationsthat have been determined to exist for a particular LDE execution. This is a 
 nontrivial problem as each edit operation can change the context of the following operations. An example 
of an ambiguous situation occurs if the positioning symbol from one operation intersects the selection 
operator for a different operation. The specification of execution order appears to be complex both 
perceptuallyfor the user and from an implementationstandpoint. Although some progress has been made 
in this area clearly a good deal more remains to be done. The design of the edit language and the parsing 
 procedureshave been arrived at empirically. Al­ though there has been a substantial effort made to 
define and understand two dimensional grammers (for example see the recent paper by Ota[7]) very little 
theoretical guidance is available for designing picture grammars as compared with the guidance that 
theories of one dimensional grammers give the designers of programming languages[8]. Reference [7] 
also contains an extensive bibliog­ raphy on earlier work in the area of two dimen­ sional grammars. 
 Two main uses of the LDE or an LDE like program can be postulated, the modification of an existing drawing 
or the initial entry of a drawing into a computer data base. An example of the LDE usage is given in 
Figures 3 and 4. Initial entry of a drawing starts with a null drawing, only the boundary square and 
just uses the commands for the addition of information to the drawing. Further­more, there is nothing 
to be compared with during the line finding phase so that step simplifies considerably. Figure 3 shows 
hand drawn edit information superimposed on an existing drawing that was processed to what is shown in 
Figure 4 by the LDE. In a sense the LDE represents a counter example to the slow but steady trend from 
batch to inter­active usage of computing systems. Indeed most of the arguments for batch vs. interactive 
com­puting that are made in the realm of software development probably apply to computer graphics as 
well. For a noninteractivegraphical program to be used instead of an interactive one the economic gains 
must outweigh a number of obvious disadvantages. The primary ones in this case being substantial increases 
in program complexity and the requirements of error free interpretation and specification of the desired 
editing. The equipment costs for both a fully interactive graphics system and a noninteractivesystem 
using a camera or other imaging device for input should be comparable. The economic advantage of the 
noninteractive (LDE like) system arises as the contact time in the noninteractive system should be substantiallyless 
than doing the same job on a fully interactive system. Most of the design difficulties in the creation 
of the edit language and the program which interprets it derive from the loss of the one parameter naturally 
available to any interactive program, the temporal ordering of the sequence of commands presented to 
it. This loss is evident at the lowest levels of processing, the separation and identificationof individual 
edit commands and at the highest levels as the edit language must include rules to specify the order 
of command execution. The cost at the lower levels is increased processing time due to the sorting and 
exhaustive search strategies employed while at the higher levels perceptual problems are incurred. For 
the reasons given above it appears that the first attempt to produce a production program of this type 
should concentrate on the initial entry of drawings into the computer data base. Most of the language 
design and program implementationproblems will be made easier by such a restriction. However, in the 
 context of this paper, the input of a drawing is much more than the detection and recording of a set 
of vectors. In addition to the obvious data entry commands for drawing symbols, lines and solder dots 
the COPY operation is a valid part of the input repertoire allowing a substantial economy in the preparation 
of certain drawings. Since the absence of temporal orderingproduces so many difficulties it should be 
obvious that the temporal ordering conveys a great amount of information besides the obvious location 
and selection operations that are normally perceived. The careful study of the ordering and construction 
 of command sequences in interactive systems will no doubt yield improved accuracy and economy of usage 
of graphical terminal equipment. The present LDE program is not suitable for production usage because 
of the simplifying assumptions made during its design. In order to build a system for production work 
a number of factors must be considered. First, a careful evaluation of sensor quality in terms of signal 
to noise, linearity and stabilitymust be made. Better signal to noise performance can lead to simpler 
algorithms for line finding. A resolution of at least 500 x 1000 lines will be needed to interpret drawings 
on a 11 by 14 inch sheet. Resolution requirements will increase propor­tionally for larger sheets. If 
textual infor­mation is to processed additional factors of 2 to 5 will be needed. In addition to the 
higher resolution manipulationof text on a schematic diagram will require processes to recognize text 
so that the appropriate recognition techniques may be used. Procedures to enable such classifi­cation 
are being researched by Wild[9]. Since the number of picture elements, thus the time spent in line finding 
operations, increases with the square of the resolution, care must be used not to overspecify the resolution. 
The line finding routines offer the best hope for improve­ ment in accuracy and speed as there is essentially 
no theoretical or deep understandingto this process. Unfortunatelythis criticism is generally true of 
most attempts at line and edge finding, not just the present program. For further information on line 
and edge finders see Fram and Deutsh[lO], who give a description and comparisonof several line and edge 
finders currently in use. Finding lines and edges is only part of the problem as the instances of edges 
and lines must be assembled that appears capable of extension to more complex representations is the 
Hough transform [11,12]. However with ade­ quate signal to noise performance in the sensor it should 
be possible to build fairly simple hard­ware to do the initial processing steps needed to extract the 
line information from the drawing with a substantial gain in processing speed. In summary, the LDE functions 
as it was designed to. All the drawing manipulation and addition functions designed have been implemented 
and work. The LDE is a possible precursor of future programs that can further automate many of the remaining 
tedious drafting jobs. Much of the technology exists now to build similar programs suitable for production 
use. Whether such a program could at this time provide benefits greater than the costs could only be 
determined with more study. The LDE also demonstrates the closeness of much of pattern recognition and 
interactive graphics. Pattern recognition can be used to replace all or part of the temporal orderingprovided 
by the users of interactive terminals. Finally, the language aspects of communicatingwith a computer 
system provide a fertile area for research as the language design phase offers the best hope for clarifying 
the information exchange that takes place when an individual communicates graphically with a computer 
system. REFERENCES 1. I. E. Sutherland, "SKETCHPAD: A Man-Machine Graphical CommunicationSystem,"

Layout* F. Hadlock Mathematics Department Florida Atlantic University Boca Raton, Florida ABSTRACT. 
PRIMS is an interactive system to be used in the layout of hybrid circuits. The layout involves positioning 
integrated circuit chips and resistors on a substrate surface. Conducting paths are then defined in 
order to make interconnections between chips, external connection pads positioned around the edge of 
the substrate, etc. PRIMS is actually a language which includes commands for defining regions corresponding 
 to integrated circuit chips, and for causing the system to define a tree of conducting paths to interconnect 
a set of points. There are also commands for displaying a partial layout, for editing the layout, and 
for generating plotter code for the final layout. 1. Hybrid Circuits and Circuit Objects. A hybrid circuit 
to us will be a circuit made up of integrated circuit chips, resistors, et cetera. Moreover an edge (or 
portion) of one region is interior to the other region. Also, edges (or portions) are deleted if they 
coincide and are opposite in direction. the packaging technique involves the positioning of the integrated 
circuit chips and resistors on a substrate surface. Conducting paths with a minimum Having defined the 
concept of rectangular region, we can define in broad fashion the purpose of PRIMS. It is to facilitate

resistors and the connection pads positioned around the substrate and chip borders. We will only be concerned 
with the case in which all regions cor­responding to chips, resistors, con­ducting paths, and pads are 
rectangular. That is, all regions are made up of tangular regions apt to occur in the lay­out of hybrid 
circuits, to facilitate the editing of these regions (any sort of modification such as scale or position 
change, change in a portion of the peri­meter, etc.), and to generate plotter code for the final collection 
of regions. In the definition phase of circuit layout, a distinction will be made between two rectangles 
with edges parallel to a substrate edge. types of circuit objects: components and conductor trees. A 
component will usual­ ly be a region associated with either an Since this concept of regions comprised 
of rectangles is important in the use of the system being des­cribed, the operation (composition of regions)

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 293 2. Interactive Circuit Layout. Circuit layout using PRIMS occurs in 
two phases. In the first phase, called the definition phase, both user and system are involved in creating 
compo­nents and conductor trees. In the second phase, called the edit phase, both user and system are 
involved in modifying or duplicating components and conductor trees. Also in the edit phase, the system, 
in response to the appropriate command, generates and stores in a file, the code for graphics display, 
plotter artwork, or for cutting rubylith masks. In the definition phase, the user will probably begin 
by defining conductor trees consisting of single points around the substrate edge. These correspond to 
pads to be used for external connections. To some extent, the environment (in which the hybrid circuit 
will be used) will dictate the cyclic order of these pads. The user will probably then, through system 
commands, create some components corresponding to integrated circuit chips or resistors. He may then 
have the system create some conductor trees. The creation of components, pads and conductor trees 
will continue with the user obtaining hardcopy displays at the terminal upon request. Upon completing 
the definition phase, the user initiates the edit phase during which he may shift, scale, rotate, reflect, 
duplicate, or make local peri­ meter changes to individual regions (corresponding to integrated circuit 
 chips, resistors, or conducting paths). After making all apparent changes, the user will normally save 
the layout and request plotter code. After inspecting the artwork generated by the plotter, the user 
may retrieve the layout for further changes or else generate code for the rubylith mask cutter. 3. Circuit 
Representation. Two different representations are used for the circuit layout. During the definition 
phase, the task of routing conducting paths requires a grid representation of the substrate and circuit 
objects. During the edit phase, the grid representation is too detailed and cumbersome. Consequently, 
during the edit phase, each circuit object, component or conductor tree, is represented by a linked 
list of points on the peri­meter of the region. That is, the corner points of the perimeter are listed 
 in clockwise order and this list of points represents the circuit object. The collection of perimeter 
lists re­presents the hybrid circuit layout. Each method of representation is employed by the user (the 
conceptual representation consisting of drawings) and by the computer (the machine re­ presentation 
consisting of arrays and pointers). In order to give the reader an overall understanding of PRIMS 
and its various commands, conceptualizationsof the two machine representations are given, along with 
the user's conceptual represen­ tations. The grid representationassumes the substrate is divided into 
a uniform grid by a series of horizontal and vertical grid lines. The user should begin the layout 
process by choosing the grid unit (5, 10, 15, 20 mils). The choice is some­ what arbitrary, the constraints 
being these. Conducting paths are of uniform width and will be considered by the system to be of width 
equal to the grid unit until the edit phase. On conversion to perimeter lists, a setoff (supplied by 
 the user) from the grid line is made for all regions. Thus if the eventual width of conducting paths 
is to be 10 mils, a 20 mil grid unit with 5 mil setoff would suf­fice. The setoff information alone is 
sup­plied to the system. When thinking about the layout in grid representation, the user thinks of position 
and dimension in terms of grid squares. In Figure 1 below appears a layout with two components (1 and 
2) and a conductor tree (3). To provide the necessary information to the system, the user numbers grid 
lines as he would those of a rectangular coordinate system. The coordinates of a grid square are the 
 rec­ tangular coordinates of its lower left corner. Component 1 is a rectangle with lower left corner 
at (1,2) and having width = 3 and height = 4. Similarly 2 is the composition of two rectangles. One 
has lower left corner (6,1) and width = 6 and height = 2. The other rectangle has lower left corner (9,1) 
and width = 3 and height = 3. The conductor tree 3 connects squares A through E with coordinates respectively 
: (10,5), (4,4), (2,1), (10,4) and (5,1).  A numbering scheme is employed by the system for naming 
circuit objects. The numbers used, for the most part, are those supplied by the user. Thus, for defining 
and editing these objects, the user would use the numbers 1, 2 or 3 (or others of his choosing). The 
machine-grid-representation employs several arrays, the main ones be­ing GRID and KROOT. Each grid square 
is represented by a 6 bit byte in the array GRID. The byte stores information about the grid square 
such as the type of circuit object (component or conductor tree) to which it belongs. A direction (East, 
North, West or South) is often assigned to a grid square and then this information is stored in the 
byte re­presenting the square. Basically, the byte is divided into 3 fields of 3 bits, 2 bits and 1 bit. 
The first field is used for circuit type (component, conductor, free or buffer) and, if conductor, the 
first field also tells the relative position of the square in the tree. The second field is used for 
 direction or for buffer level. The third field is a status bit for the routing algorithm for free squares 
or buffer squares. For component squares, the third field differentiates between perimeter and internal 
squares. In the machine-grid-representation, direction has several applications. The machine-grid-representationof 
a conductor tree is a directed tree. The user gives the squares to be connected by the tree, designating 
one square as root. The coordinates of the root square go in the array KROOT in location n where n is 
the name of the tree being created. In the directed tree repre­sentation, there is a directed path from 
every square in the tree to the root. This offers a means of identi­fying a conductor tree (the ability 
to do so is essential in routing). Simply trace the tree to its root, scan KROOT to match coordinates 
and take the location as the name of the tree. (An alternative would be to store the circuit object 
identificationin every grid square belonging to it, doubling the amount of storage for only 64 possible 
objects). The machine-grid-representation of components also uses direction. Each perimeter square is 
assigned a direction so that one traces the perimeter in clockwise fashion by following these directions. 
The lower left corner of a component consisting of a single rectangle is used as a root. For more complex 
components, it will be some corner assigned by the system during composition of the rectangles. In any 
case, the coordinates of the root are entered in KROOT, again in the location given by the name of the 
object. Direction is essential in the system's approach to creating conductor trees. Initially the 
conductor tree consists of just the root square. Each of the other squares (to be connected) is connected 
to this tree using a shortest path algorithm that creates a minimum distance tree (here distance is 
a linear combination of actual distance, turns, X­overs and buffer costs). This minimum distance tree 
is represented as a directed tree with root being the square to be con­nected. As soon as it becomes 
possible to add a conductor tree square to the minimum distance tree, an optimum connection has been 
found. The system traces the path to the root (the square to be connected) changing the circuit types 
of the path squares from free or buffer to conductor (except where crossings occur) and re­versing the 
directions. Finally, direction also has ap­plication in converting from grid to peri­meter list representation. 
Since adjacent squares can belong to circuit objects of the same type, the type information is not 
sufficient to delineate between regions. However adjacent squares of the same type belong to the same 
region if either is directed into the other. Perimeter list representation,in contrast to grid representation, 
is very simple. The user may think of it as lists of corner points encountered in traversing the perimeters 
in clockwise fashion or in counter-clockwisefashion. Any corner is valid as a starting point and either 
order is acceptable. The machine representation employs an array P together with an array LNK for storing 
 these lists as linked circular lists. An array KTOP stores pointers to the peri­meter lists. A conductor 
tree created in the definition phase, (and named K), would have its root coordinates stored in the Kth 
location of KROOT. During the edit phase, a pointer to the list of corner points on its perimeter would 
be stored in the Kth location of KTOP. Thus conversion does not change region names. An example of 
the machine-grid-re­presentation (actually a conceptualization of it) of a circuit layout is given below. 
The user's version of the perimeter list representation of the same layout is also given. Note the 
offset supplied by the system in conversion from grid to peri­meter list representation.  Fig. 2.b 
-User's Version of Perimeter Lists for Regions 1, 2, and 3 4. The Interactive Layout Process: Definition 
Phase. The purpose of this section is to illustrate the use of PRIMS by showing how it might be used 
in defining a sample layout. First some general comments are necessary concerning the nature of PRIMS 
and the format of PRIMS commands. PRIMS is an interactive software system and, as such, responds to 
specific user commands. The intention here is to provide a tool for the user experienced in hybrid circuit 
layout. For the most part, the user makes decisions and the system is involved in bookkeeping and calculations 
necessary for editing or for artwork generation. Only in the area of routing, after the locations of 
the points to be connected have been determined by the user, does the system make decisions. And here 
the user may intervene and dictate the routing if he wishes. The format of PRIMS commands is simple 
and nearly uniform. Every command is composed of a 2 character operation code followed by a 2 character 
operand name. The operation codes are listed in Appendix 1. The operand name is usually a 2 digit 
number used as the name of the region affected by the command. Commands to INitialize or Halt require 
no operand and the PRINT command requires an operand which designates the output device. The layout 
process will usually be­gin with the INitialize command. A rectangular border corresponding to the 
size of the substrate is 1st established, the user giving lower left corner (normal­ ly 0,0) width and 
height. Next the user provides the system with cost information which will be used to optimally route 
conducting paths. Costs for distance, turns, X-overs, additional X-overs, a X-over limit, and 4 buffer 
costs are given. The user will have either a partial layout or else a complete trial layout in mind. 
In the latter case the system is only being used to decrease the large amount of information needed 
to describe a complete layout in plotter code terms. Also since the PRIMS runstream is a more conceptual 
description than is plotter code, errors are easier to locate and cor­rect in a PRIMS runstream file 
than a plotter code file. Figure 3 is a simple layout for the purpose of illustrating the PRIMS definition 
phase.  Figure 3. -Two Components and Two Conductor Trees. (The run named 9 by PRIMS is still regarded 
as part of tree 8 in spite of the Xover.) The two components are defined after the INitialize command 
using the CM com­mand. Naming them 1 and 2, PRIMS would prompt the user for the position. -size information. 
The user would respond with 13,12,6,3 and with 17,7,7,3 for the components in Figure 3. The conductor 
tree consisting of a single horizontal run from (7,8) to (16,8) might be named 5, have root (7,8) and 
1 additional point to be connected at (16,8). The other conductor tree might be named 8 and is similarly 
constructed. The two trees would be defined with commands CN5 and CN8. Following each command, the 
system would prompt the user for the coordinates of the root, number of additional points, and their 
 coordinates. The user would respond with (7,8), 1, (16,8) and (15,16), 1, (21,5) for the trees in Figure 
3. At this point, it seems appropriate to digress from the illustration of PRIMS commands and to go 
into some detail as to the mechanics of conductor tree construction. Basically, the approach is to regard 
the grid as a graph. Grid squares are regarded as vertices, each having at most 4 neighbors corresponding 
to the grid squares to the East, North, West and South. In constructing the tree, the root is regarded 
as the initial conductor tree. Each subsequent point is connected to the existing conductor tree. If 
the user responds with 4 as to the number of additional points, 4 separate paths would be constructed, 
one to connect each point to the existing tree in the order in which they are supplied by the user. For 
each point T = (x, y) a least cost path is selected using a shortest path algorithm (at­tributed by Dijkstra) 
which builds a minimum distance tree rooted at T. (Root here is used in the directed tree sense.) The 
algorithm proceeds by adding to the tree, the unattached vertex nearest the root. Generally this requires 
scanning each tree vertex and considering each unattached neighbor. Thus the general step (adding a 
 vertex to the minimum distance tree) requires a number of steps proportional to the number of vertices 
in the mini­ mum distance tree. Essentially there are at most 4 + 2 (n-l) additions and as many comparisons 
to be made where n is the number of vertices in the tree. This bound stems from the fact that in the 
grid graph each vertex (grid square) has at most 4 neighbors. Each time an unattached neighbor is 
added, the net increase of unattached neighbors to the tree is 2. If m is the final size of the tree 
when the conductor tree is reached, this adds up to at most (4 + 2 (n-l) = m(m + 3) additions n=l 
and comparisons. Now the minimum distance tree grows out from T with no special inclination to grow in 
the direction of the conductor tree. In the interests of speeding up the shortest path algorithm and 
at the risk of coming up with a greater than least cost path, a 'topological' technique is used. The 
rectangular hull of the ter­minal squares (end squares) of the exist­ing conductor tree and the next 
square to be connected is the smallest rectangle containing these squares. A series of concentric rectangular 
frames is con­structed. The frames are centered about the hull and are constructed of buffer squares 
of successively higher levels as you move away from the hull. By including a buffer cost of the speci­fied 
level for each buffer square of that level in the path, the minimum distance tree is influenced to grow 
in the direction of the existing conductor tree. X-overs are still avoided if the X-over cost is high 
relative to the buffer cost. In Figure 3, conductor tree 8 was routed by the system so as to X-over conductor 
tree 5 since the costs given made the butter frames in­fluence the route to stay within the hull. At 
any time during the definition phase, the user may obtain a terminal display of the layout with a PR 
3 com­mand. The operand 3 used with the PRint command is for displaying the layout in grid representationat 
the terminal. The figure below demonstrates the use of PR 3. The user specifies the rectangular portion 
of the chip to be displayed by giving lower left corner coordinates, width and height. The bordering 
rectangle of c's was established during initializationand keeps the routing algorithm from wandering 
off the edge of the substrate.  Fig. 4 -a Terminal Display of a Layout The final command of the definition 
phase is always a CV command which has the effect of converting the layout re­ presentation from grid 
to perimeter list. The conversion process is ac­complished first by collecting all the straight line 
segments occurring in the perimeters of regions corresponding to components or is done by conductor 
trees. This two passes, one vertical and one horizontal, over the array GRID. In the vertical pass, 
a window consisting of 4 grid squares with coordinates (i,j), (i+l,j), (i+l,j+l), and (i,j+l) is passed 
over the entire array, serving to determine all vertical segments. Similarly, the horizontal segments 
are determined during the horizontal pass. A clockwise traversal of peri­meters assigns a direction 
to each segment, i.e., the direction in which it is traversed (East, North, West, South). In displacing 
segments to accomplish the set-off from grid lines, East segments are displaced downward and have a 
terminal position below the horizontal grid line with which it previously coincided. For this reason, 
 East segments are referred to as BH Segments (Below Horizontal). Similarly, North segments are RV 
segments (Right Vertical), West segments are AH segments (Above Horizontal) while South segments are 
LV segments (Left Vertical). The segment tree is organized into 4 sub­ trees, one for each segment 
type. With­in a subtree, there is a branch for each column or row (depending on the subtree type) 
row containing segments. The branch is a linked list of segments occurring in the corresponding 
column or row. Grid squares designated as root squares are given special attention in conversion. 
 The 1st time they come under scan within the 4 square window, a segment must be originating, under scan 
 or terminating since root squares occur only on perimeters of components or conductor trees. The 
segment being determined is designated as a root segment and the status of the square is changed from 
root to non-root. In this way, a 1-1 mapping of region names onto root segments is established. 
The region name is stored in the segment tree with its root segment. After the two passes, all segments 
have been determined and entered into the segment tree. Perimeter lists are constructed by processing 
this tree. The tree is scanned until a root segment is located. A perimeter list will be con­structed 
for the region corresponding to this root segment. The idea is to trace out the perimeter in clockwise 
fashion, entering corner points into the perimeter list as they occur as common endpoints of two 
successive segments traversed. Of two successive segments, one will be vertical and the other horizontal. 
The type of vertical segment determines the direction of horizontal displacement; the type of horizontal 
segment determines the direction of vertical displacement. The necessary computation for the offset 
is performed as the point is entered into the perimeter list. In tracing out the perimeter, the rule 
is simply that segments must alternate between vertical and horizontal. It may very well occur that 
two segments have a common endpoint. However, by giving preference to right turns and, given the direction 
of the turn, picking the proper type, the right segment is selected by searching at most two sub­trees 
for a segment which articulates with the last. The following figure illustrates the use of the CV 
command. The resultant perimeter list representation is printed. The lists are printed as they are 
formed in the order in which the cor­ responding root segments are discovered in the segment tree. 
 This would be the perimeter list representation of the layout in Figure 2. The addition of a region 
is the result of a X-over. The system automatically appropriates the first unused name after the 
name of the conductor tree. In this case 9 was the first unused name after 8.   The system is now 
in the edit phase. Some of the commands used in this phase are illustrated in the next section. 5. The 
Interactive Layout Process: Edit Phase The purpose of this section is to illustrate the use of PRIMS 
during the edit phase. It may be that no changes are desired. At this point a PR 1 command will generate 
plotter code from the perimeter lists, a fairly straight forward task. The plotter code in figure 6 consists 
of two com­mands: (x,y,4) means (move to position (x,y) with pen up and (n, 0, 2) means move distance 
r at an angle 0 with pen down.  Generally the user will wish to modi­fy the layout created during 
the defini­tion phase. The edit commands fall into four general categories: commands for duplications, 
for non-rigid transforma­tions, for rigid transformations, and for input/output. To illustrate some of 
the commands, the simple layout in Figure 7.a is assumed to have been produced during the definition 
phase. This layout is con­verted using the CV command and now some edit commands are employed to produce 
the layout in Figure 7.b. The first command after the perimeter  lists produced by the CV command is 
a STep command. ST 5 will produce copies of 5 to be given successive integer names starting with 6. 
There will be 3 copies, the 1st of width .5 . They will be shifted so as to have intervening intervals 
of 1.5 and each copy will be produced from the pre­ ceding using a scale factor of 1. in the X direction. 
Similarly, a series of conductor runs extending downward from the bottom edge of component I is created 
with the ST10 command. The PAtch command replaces a portion of the perimeter list with a 'patch' list. 
In this case a conducting run, extending out from the left side of region 1, is created. To use the PAtch 
command, two points, P and Q, on the existing perimeter are needed. In clockwise order, let P occur followed 
by a list of points X (pos­sibly vacuous), followed by Q. The user inputs PYQP where Y is the patch list. 
Note that P is repeated to terminate the input. In the example, P = (5.25, 6.25), Q = (5.25, 10.75) while 
Y = [(5.25, 8,25), (2.25, 8.25), (2.25, 8.75), (5.25, 8.75)]. X is vacuous. Since rectangles can have 
minimum dimension 2, this conducting run could not have been accomplished during the definition phase 
through composition of rectangles (repeated use of the CM com­mand). Figure 6. -Plotter Code For the 
Perimeter lists in Figure 5.   Figure 7.b -The Layout After Being Modified During Edit Phase Several 
other edit commands perhaps require comment in addition to the ex­planation in Appendix 1. While the 
PA command is useful for major perimeter  changes, it is cumbersome in correcting the coordinates of 
a single point (this kind of error is apt to occur when the user inputs a perimeter list during edit 
using the ReaD command). For single point corrections, the user employs the PLug command. Prior to doing 
so, he would employ the DuMp command to display the perimeter list containing the point in error. The 
link or pointer is displayed along with the coordinates of each point. This link is used to reference 
the point to be corrected by PLug. While PAtch and PLug affect non-rigid  transformations, SHift, SCale, 
ROtate, and ReFlect affect rigid transformations. All of these latter except SHift involve the rectangular 
hull of the operand region. For example, SC K would have the following effect on region K. If P is 
the center of K's hull, each point Q on K's perimeter is transformed into a point Q' by scaling the 
X,Y distances of Q from P. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The design and development of PRIMS would not have been possible 
without the interest of and discussions with a number of people at the Naval Avionics Facility. In particular, 
Tom Higbie and Robert Lafara provided much insight into the nature and constraints of hybrid circuit 
layout. APPENDIX I List of Commands Definition Phase Commands  Oper-Effect of Command ation Code

 1-213-536-1947 A comprehensive computer-aided mask layout technique has been developed which permits 
quick conversion of LSI circuits into working photomasks. It isan efficient solution to the problem when 
the demand for customized circuit layouts greatly overshadows the more standardized techniques. No computer 
background or programming experience is required. This approach allows the designer to quickly compose 
high-density mask layouts using simple free-hand line symbols. These easily drawn symbols, representing 
complex circuitry, utilize a standard device-level building block library which simplifies the conversion 
of LSI circuits into photomasks, and permits the designer to generate up to 100% of the layout without 
leaving his desk. 1. INTRODUCTION The computer-aidedcoarse grid layout technique is a flexible approach 
with outstanding features that has been found to be invaluable when itis imprac­ tical to standardize 
special circuit configura­tions[3]. This concept facilitates the creation of customized high-density 
cell and die layouts through the use of a device-level building block library based on a coarse grid 
(> 5pm) interconnect scheme. Not only does this layout technique signi­ ficantly reduce the typical die 
design time, but it also offers the design engineer a very efficient means of interfacing with an iterative 
graphics design system. See Figure 1.  2. COMMONLY USED PHOTOMASK LAYOUT TECHNIQUES A brief description 
of the three most commonly used LSI photomask layout techniques is presented to illustrate some of 
the inherent design restric­ tions associated with each approach. 2.1 Standard Manual Layout Approach 
 Manually creating LSI photomask layouts involves the generation of master artwork at large scales to 
permit accurate photoreduction of the geometric details. The physical size of such drawings, some measuring 
up to 30 feet, are impractical to handle. It is a major task to properly check and revise these drawings, 
not to mention the documentation and storage requirements.  2.2 CAD Layout Approach with Standard Devices 
 TRW's iterative graphics design system (Applicon Graphic System/700) reduces the composition of LSI 
circuit layout drawings through interaction with the designer and an on-line computer. Standardized 
metal interconnectand device geometries are de­ fined on a 1pm working grid and stored into the computer 
memory as digital information. The de­ signer interfaces with the system through a combin­ation of a 
remote digitizer and a CRT console. He then recalls copies of the required devices from the memory and 
positions them at specified coor­dinates on the master drawing file as required. The finished drawing 
is stored inmemory until required for production of plotted drawings for record purposes, or for the 
generation of the mag­netic tape which issent to a photomask fabrication facility. Although the typical 
LSI photomask design cycle is greatly reduced, experience has shown that there are some restrictions, 
as listed below, which occur once the basic drawing file isplaced in the com­puter memory. . Itisimpractical 
for more than one person at a time to implement changes to a parti­cular drawing file by means of CRT 
editing. . CRT editing iscostly due to availability of allocated computer time. .A change inthe basic 
metal interconnect of device geometry usually necessitates a major drawing file redesign. . The approximate 
time required for a change isinverselyproportional to the basic working grid unit. A small working grid 
requires more time.  2.3 CAD Layout Approach with Standard Cells Most computer-aideddesign systems 
are based on the standard cell building block concept. Groups of individual devices are combined into 
geometric "standard cells", such as gates and flip-flops, and stored into the computer memory. The operation 
 of positioning and interconnecting on the master die drawing can be performed automatically or man­ually. 
This isvery efficient inthat the die de­sign time issignificantlyreduced; however, there are some characteristicswhich 
can restrict the creative productivity of the LSI engineering group, such as: . Fixed Cell input/output 
node locations. . Fixed Cell signal and power buss line widths. . Inefficient interconnect density due 
to cell interfacial restrictions. . Generally larger die size due to internal cell restrictions.  3. 
CAD LAYOUT APPROACH WITH COARSE GRID A new layout scheme isbeing used which eliminates these problems. 
This LSI photomask layout concept isactually a combination of all three of the pre­vious layout techniques 
to provide a fast method of creating and revising "customized" circuit cells from scratch, using a standard 
devices building block library. See Figure 2.  Figure 2 -Standard 5pm Grid Devices (B)Actual device 
composite of all levels.  This approach basically allows the design engineer to compose his rough circuit 
layouts using simple line symbols to represent the devices within the circuit, and to interconnect 
the devices on a >5pm grid with simple point-to-pointlines, representing metallization,as required. 
Figure 5A shows a typ­ ical rough (free-hand)cell layout. This rough layout isthen digitized directly 
into position on the master drawing file of the computer memory. The degree of efficiency inusing this 
technique depends on the degree of compromise inobtaining a practical rough layout grid. Three problems 
were successfully solved during the development of this technique: . Determination of appropriate 
grid for rough layout, . Definition of devices such that a symbolic interconnect centerline falls 
 on the 5pm grid, and . Generation of 5um grid device spacing guide.  3.1 Determination of Grid for 
Rough Layout Two factors were responsible for the decision to select a practical rough layout grid 
size with increments of 1/10 inch = 5m and 1/2 inch = 1 mil  (by definition). First, dimensional criteria 
established Metal-1 (first of two metallization levels) width to be 8um minimum, and metal-to-metal 
spacing to be 2um minimum. The centerline-to-cen­ terline spacing of Metal-1is10um minimum. Metal-2 (secondmetallization 
level) minimums are 18um width and 7um spacing, with centerline-to-cen­ terline spacing of 25um. The 
second reason for selecting this particular grid was based on experimentationwith various digitizers. 
Itwas found that internal command recognition restrictionsmade itdifficult to digitize from a rough layout 
and accurately posi­tion the devices on specified coordinates when the grid spacing was less than 1/10 
inch.  3.2 Definition of Device with Symbolic Centerline 3.3 Guide for 5 Grid Device Spacing A family 
of standard devices has been created with all levels defining each device associatedwith a centerline 
on the 5um grid, even though some actual geometries are designed to the nearest 1/4um (Fig­ure 2B). Each 
device has its own unique symbolic centerline arrangement to permit device recogni­tion. This isnecessary 
when the design engineer generates his rough layout, and later when the circuit is digitized into the 
master drawing file of the computer memory. The 5pm device spacing guide (See Figure 3) isan essential 
aide required during the composition stage of a circuit layout. Itshows the minimum spacing relationship 
of all possible device con­ figurations and combinations. Each device has four positive reference code 
points. These code points, located along the left side and bottom borders of the spacing guide, are cross-referenced 
to obtain the minimum grid spacing. This particu­ lar guide shows how 11 basic devices can be arranged 
in 526 different positions, accounting for every practical arrangement required during an average die 
design.  Figure 3 -Guide for 5um Grid Device Spacing  Figure 4 -Basic Cell Schematic Diagram 4. APPLICATION 
OF 5um GRID INA TYPICAL DIE DESIGN Initially, the designer verifies compliance with five basic prerequisites 
before beginning the actual layout. . Circuit islogically divided into blocks of cells at 125X with 
prelim­inary bussing diagrams. . Schematics contain all the necessary information, denoting special 
con­straints, matched pairs, high current devices, etc. . Rough stick figure interconnect drawings establish 
interface require­ments. .Signal interconnect isestablished to be on Metal-1whenever possible. .Buss 
interconnect isestablished to be on Metal-2 whenever possible.  After the basic prerequisites have been 
satisfied, each cell layout ina typical die design involves the following six steps: Step 1 The design 
engineer obtains a standard device handbook for the applicable technologyand makes same size copies 
of the 500X 5um grid devices (Figure 2A) and the 5um device spacing guide (Fig­ ure 3). Step 2 The layout 
iscreated on stabilized, reproducible 1/10 inch (transparent) grid paper infree-hand sketch style. The 
500X device template isslid into position under the grid paper, allowing the design engineer to quickly 
outline the applicable symbols as required. The devices are interconnectedon the 5um grid using a solid 
line to repre­sent Metal-1,and a dashed line to represent Metal-2 (Figure 5A). The cell circuit layout 
terminates at logical interface points.  Step 3 Reference designators are assigned to each component 
inthe circuit layout inaccordance to the schematic diagram (Figure 4). Length adjustments are indicated 
for each resistor that must be adjusted tighter than the 5um grid permits. Step 4 The approved layout 
isdirectly digi­tized into position on the master drawing file of the computer memory. This isaccomplished 
through the use of a digitizing procedure built around a simple point-to-pointsingle stroke coordinate 
system. The starting refer­ence point (dot on left side of device-- Figure 3)locates the device and 
the second reference point (dot on right) orientates and stretches the geometry as desired. Single dot 
devices are assumed to have a second reference point one grid increment to the right of the starting 
point dot (by definition).  Step 5 A 500X symbolic check plot (Figure 5B)isgenerated from the computer 
memoryand compared with the initial roughlayout (Figure 5A). The rough layoutand the symbol plot are 
superimposed over a light table and checked for diff­ erences--the fastest method of finding digitizing 
errors. Finally, a complete composite isgenerated (Figure 5C).  Step 6 Intermediate die plots are generated 
at 125X and/or 250X as the various cells are digitized into position on the master drawing file. These 
plots are checked to verify that the peripheral components and circuitry cells are progressing as planned 
per basic prerequisites. After the design iscompleted and approved, the stored digital information iscopied 
onto amag­netic tape and sent to a photomask fab­ rication facility.  5. ADVANTAGES OF COARSE GRID APPROACH 
 This technique offers an efficient solution to the problem when the demand for customized circuit layouts 
isgreater than the more standardized techniques[2,3]. Some of the outstanding advan­tages are listed 
below: . No special computer background or program­ ming knowledge isrequired. . Simple line device 
symbols permit gener­ation of free-hand circuit layouts, repre­senting complex circuitry, which can be 
 digitized directly into position on the master drawing of the computer memory. . Digitizing time of 
an average layout is reduced from several days to a couple of hours. . Symbolic plots reduce the average 
plottime of a typical cell from one hour to 15 minutes. .CRT editing isreduced to a minimum by virtue 
of the efficient manner of placing the cell layout information into the master drawing file of the computer 
 memory. . Changes are easily implemented and seldom necessitate major drawing file redesign. .Final 
layout check procedure iscompat­ible with automated evaluation techniques.  6. OTHER APPLICATIONSOF 
COARSE GRID APPROACH This technique can be easily extended to other graphic applications. The process 
issimilar to LSI approach inthat the devices are created with symbolic centerlines falling on a desired 
grid. Then a border rectangle isplaced around the cen­terline establishing a unique identification sym­bol 
with four positive reference code points (Figure 3). The spacing increments are determined to be the 
minimum coarse grid spacing acceptable between any two positive reference points. Some of the other 
graphic application areas which would benefit from this approach are listed below: . Printed circuit 
layouts. . Multilayer circuit layouts. . Thick and thin film hybrid circuit layouts.  Figure 5 -Typical

successful in reducing the design time of customized high-density cell and die photo­ mask layouts. 
Demonstrationshave shown that the overall photomask layout time has been reduced by more than 400%. 
This asset improves die qual­ ity by permittingmore time to be devoted to circuit function design effort. 
The design engineer is provided with a simplified layout concept which facilitates quick conversion 
of LSI circuits into photomasks. This technique reduces the typical die design time through the use 
of a standard device-level building block library, and it allows the designer to generate up to 100% 
of the circuit layout without leaving his desk. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author would like to thank David
