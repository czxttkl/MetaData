 Hybrid Basketry: Interweaving Digital Practice within Contemporary Craft Amit Zoran ABSTRACT Contemporary 
3D printing and traditional craft rarely meet in the same creation. They tend to live in different worlds. 
In this paper, the author argues for merging these two distinct traditions. To that end, he developed 
hybrid basketry, a medium where 3D-printed structures are shaped to allow the growth and development 
of hand-woven patterns. While the 3D-printed plastic elements contribute the aesthetics of the digital 
curvatures and manifolds, the hand-woven reed, jute, and canvas fibers infuse the baskets with a unique 
organic appeal. The author discusses his motivation, describes the making process, and presents four 
hybrid baskets, integrating a deeper discussion on the place of craft and tradition within our contemporary 
approach to design and fabrication. Introduction Design language is constantly changing. Digital fabrication 
is on the rise, and parametric tools are transforming the design landscape. Three-dimensional printing 
is the hot topic of the day, enabling digital practitioners to rapidly implement their ideas [1]. The 
intrinsic nature of this programmable mode of creation has a major impact on the physical value of the 
produced artifact. In particular, digitally designed artifacts are intrinsically reproducible: one can 
always make another identical copy of a 3D-printed object. This style of production stands in stark contrast 
to traditional craft, where artifacts are individually produced, and repetition of the exact same design 
is almost impossible. While craft and art are dynamic practices that respond to new technology trends, 
3D printing is still a sterile domain, limited to digital media. In my work, I seek a dialog between 
digital practice and traditional craft, merging qualities to create a hybrid territory. I demonstrate 
that tradition can be merged into a hybrid, contemporary making practice that respects its double origins. 
While computational digital design enables an exploration of forms and structures free from traditional 
fabrication limitations, craft contributes an intimate engagement between the maker, the material, and 
the product. In an early project, I merged digital fabrication with ceramic craft in a process that requires 
an actual restoration of traditional handcrafted objects [2]. I used innovative 3D fabrication techniques 
to articulate the absent form of the broken originals, thus creating something new while also commemorating 
what was lost. For example, by holding shards of pottery together with a 3D-printed lattice that follows 
its naturally implied form, a new object is created from pieces of a shattered one. In this way, technology 
is used not simply in the service of the revolutionary possibilities of digital production, but also 
in the service of other one-of-a-kind artifacts. In the projects presented in this paper, 3D-printed 
structures are designed to accept the development of hand-woven fiber, intertwining the two different 
practices into a single artifact. In contrast to a fully digitized design process, hybrid basketry is 
a search for agreement and collaboration between practices. A unity among subjective investment, the 
use of organic materials, and uniqueness of the final artifact is sought. Here, I explore a synergy between 
digital practice and craft, based on equality rather than breakage and trauma as in my early work. Following 
this motivation, I present four hybrid basket projects that span a creative space of parametric design 
as well as manual artistry. But before delving into the artifacts, I will start by providing some context 
on the art of basketry. Context: Basket Makers and Cultural Expression Looking at my work, people have 
to see many different pieces. Often my work is from dreaming when I sleep, I dream the patterns and then 
I draw them, they become clear to me in time and then I put colors together. Each one, for me, is special. 
None are the same. -Thitaku Kushonya, workshop brochure Thitaku Kushonya is a traditional basket maker 
from Maun, Botswana (Figure 1). Learning basketry from her mom, who used to make functional containers 
for domestic use, Kushonya gave it a modern interpretation by adopting a Western view on originality, 
uniqueness, and the individual. She doesn t want her work to be used, but rather to be presented and 
treated as artwork. Each of her coiled palm-fiber works has a different graphical pattern. Basket-making 
time can vary from a week or two up to several months, depending on the complexity of the work. Designs 
and patterns are not arbitrary; they are influenced by traditional Kavango style and dreams. Thitak emphasizes 
the uniqueness of the work and the originality of the graphic. She has her personal intention and technique, 
so she is the only person producing her baskets. I first met Kushonya in July 2011 while collecting materials 
on traditional African craft. I was mostly influenced by the level of engagement Thitaku, similar to 
other local makers, has with her practice an intimacy that stood in stark contrast to the digital realm 
of my work. Collecting palm leaves in the Kavango delta, preparing the fibers and their pigments, designing 
and making the baskets: each of the making stages has potential for creative experimentation. For example, 
in addition to the variety of patterns and forms, Thitaku investigates alternative materials, such as 
fibers made from a green nylon bag mixed with palm fibers, and demonstrates the flexibility of a tradition 
that is often considered highly conservative. Thitaku Kushonya is more than just a gifted maker. She 
is also the voice of the Botswana basketry tradition, traveling abroad, promoting the traditional craft, 
visiting local villages to collect baskets and train makers as producers of collected artwork rather 
than functional objects. Working with over 450 traditional weavers, Thitaku s organization, Botswana 
Quality Baskets, empowers makers to use their craft to become self-sufficient, assisting the producers 
with quality training, design, marketing, and logistics. In an age where mass-produced plastic and nylon 
containers are cheaper and more accessible, basket makers are looking for identity. Contemporary basketry 
in Africa, like other traditional crafts around the world, is losing its place as a practical tradition. 
While knowledge is still preserved by older generations, the search for modern identity is moving forward. 
At the heart of basketry lies the practice of intertwining different material elements to reinforce an 
artificial structure. Unlike woodworking, blacksmithing, and pottery, basketry is not tied to a specific 
raw material or tool. Basketry practice grows from the inside out like trees growing over time in an 
organic and emergent process. This is the art of pattern repetition and structural growth, as discussed 
by Tim Ingold in his essay On Weaving a Basket [3]. But similar to cloth making, most baskets are based 
on organic materials, which makes it difficult to study their origins [4]. Recently, archeologists have 
demonstrated the possibility of an early use of bamboo basketry in Southeast Asia, even with the absence 
of stone tools [5], by reconstructing early craft conditions of a pre-agricultural period. Based on evidence 
from bird weavings, it is safe to assume that basketry is one of the oldest practices of humanity. Ancient 
as it may be, basketry is a flexible craft that was independently developed by many cultures. It appears 
in a huge variety of forms, designs, and sizes. Raw material varies from bamboo and cane [6] to pine 
and leaves [7], and today even metal and plastic wires. Many basket traditions borrow elements from other 
crafts, such as wooden handles and legs. These qualities of basketry (adaptability, changeability, and 
usage of a variety of technologies and raw materials) make it a perfect domain for experimentation. Many 
contemporary makers have visualized this quality, and beautiful examples are illustrated by Billie Ruth 
Sudduth s Baskets: A Book for Makers and Collectors [8]. Exploration As an accommodating, forgiving craft, 
basketry invites collaboration with digital practices. Technically, the construction of one-dimensional 
elements that use woven (or other) patterns, and the discrete nature of the basket s graphics, are relatively 
easy to model. Indeed, over the last few years several projects have articulated the use of computational 
technology to explore digital weaving. An example is the work of Rizal Muslimin [9], who demonstrates 
how computational design of woven structures can be implemented in architecture. While algorithms for 
digital weaving have been explored in an early work by Matilda McQuaid [10], Zubin Khabazi enabled designers 
to study and implement computational weaving using Grasshopper, a parametric plug-in to Rhino3D [11]. 
He divided a 3D surface into a woven pattern of warps (the longitudinal thread), and wefts (the transverse 
thread) creating networks of woven curvatures. This last work served as a starting point for my investigation. 
Basket I Due to its woven structure, I call this first work a basket, but it may resonate more with the 
traditional shape of a vase. Modifying Khabazi s weaving algorithm, this artifact demonstrates digital 
possibilities that cannot be implemented in traditional practice (Figure 2). Using an Objet Connex 3D 
printer, which allows a linear combination of two different printed materials, a smooth surface was deformed 
to a woven pattern by several linear steps (from the bottom up). Basket I demonstrates surface deforming, 
starting with a smooth texture and a single white color and developing to a woven pattern with black 
warps (Objet s flexible material) and white wefts (Objet s rigid material). In the bottom of the basket, 
I manually wove natural reed into the pre-designed 3D-printed wefts, to achieve a simple demonstration 
of hybrid structure. Basket I demonstrates the potential in revising 3D printing and digital design to 
achieve traditional craft aesthetics, such as the woven pattern. Starting by designing a sleeve with 
freehand deformation of a cylindrical surface, I then decomposed the surface to warps and wefts. Based 
on Khabazi s work, my modification of his algorithm enabled a non-uniform woven development, allowing 
control of the relative distance of the warps from the base surface. This virtually designed structure 
was then printed in one piece, before weaving the wet, flexible reed inside it. Basket II Basket I is 
an aesthetic illustration of the potential of parametric design and multi-material 3D printers. However, 
the manual part of that work is limited and doesn t show a balanced exchange between the practices. As 
a digital practitioner, it was my first attempt to design for manual weaving. While Basket II still mainly 
relies on digital process, it presents a higher degree of investment and skill development for the maker 
(Figure 3). In Basket II, I used a new implementation to join reed and 3D-printed structures, rather 
than the weaving technique. I used a structure of layers, where 3D-printed miniature arms (Nylon 12 material 
printed by a selective laser-sintering process) are the bases of the basket, and two separate horizontal 
and vertical reed layers cover it from the outside. Due to its size (60cm long), this basket when printed 
was divided into four separate parts that were glued together manually. Several virtual renders were 
made beforehand, to test dyes and different reed arrangements, prior to manually completing the design 
and gluing the reeds to the structure. Basket III Basket III demonstrates a weaving technique, wherein 
in a 3D-printed lattice guides the woven reed in pre-defined paths (Figure 4). Similar to the previous 
work, dyed reed was manually woven into the brittle 3D-printed nylon object, reinforcing it to a solid 
artifact. The design of the basket is based on 2D weaving guides (Figure 5) that were rotated to achieve 
a closed oval shape. The printed nylon acts as the basket s wefts, while the reeds are the warps. This 
basket owes its shape to the marriage between the two materials. The 3D-printed structure alone doesn 
t resemble the final form, and the two elements are essential in order to achieve physical stability. 
In many aspects, the result was a surprise, since the final hybrid shape was not simulated during the 
design, and the aesthetic qualities of the basket first appeared while manually weaving the reed (which 
took approximately six hours). For me, this work was the first real workmanship of risk within the hybrid 
basketry project a quality so essential to real craft [12], where the shape of the crafted object is 
never predetermined. Basket IV The last project is, in a sense, the most accurate manifestation of my 
intention within hybrid basketry (Figure 6). Here, unlike the previous projects, the manual investment 
was greater than the digital one, as it took me almost a week of work (2-3 hours a day) to complete the 
weaving of canvas and jute ropes inside the 3D-printed construction. While the overall shape of the basket 
depends on the computational process (and may be difficult to achieve within traditional practice), the 
woven pattern was only partially pre-defined in the computer, and a lot of freedom was available for 
the weaving stage itself. The 3D-printed sleeve was designed in a process similar to Basket I: starting 
with a sleeve and using freehand deformation of a surface, I sliced the surface to horizontal bands and 
used these slices to make deformed cylinders (Figure 7). This cylindrical weft structure constrains the 
weaving s vertical pattern. In addition, the horizontal density of the weaving process, the weaving pattern 
itself (such as how many wefts should be included in one loop), and the type of rope and its color (canvas 
or jute) allow for a vast design exploration during the making process. The result is a unique artifact, 
with a singular surface pattern. The 3D-printed structure offers digital freedom, but it requires the 
woven rope for reinforcement and stability. Summary In this paper, I explore what have conventionally 
been treated as two divergent realms: emerging digital technologies and timeless hand-hewn craft. This 
work allowed me as a digital practitioner to be engaged in the making process and invest many hours practicing 
my new unique basketry skills. It is, in a sense, a physical manifestation of an intensifying desire 
to develop a new way of thinking about these polarities: the machine, as generator of control and innovation, 
and human manual skill, as preserver of artistic production and culture. This is an investigation of 
our digital culture and our potential to reclaim a lost material identity in the cyberspace of design 
and fabrication. Here, two distinguished practices, hand-woven organic fiber patterns and computationally 
driven 3D-printed structures, are assembled to become a hybrid material territory. My hope is to substantiate 
a this new hybrid territory for investigation and discovery, in which the value of artifacts produced 
by both machine and man can infuse our excitement about technological progress with a need to remember 
the very soil from which it came. While the motivation of this work was to encourage dialog between material 
practices, this essay demonstrates a work by one individual. While mastering the digital-design arena, 
I took only a few steps toward the craft of weaving. As such, the scope is limited to my subjective interpretation 
and perspective, and thus more work is needed, with more participation by creative makers to claim a 
cultural practice. Hopefully this project will inspire other makers to preserve and integrate, while 
still innovating and progressing. Acknowledgements I would like to acknowledge Marilyn Levine, Roy Shilkrot,

 KIMA A Holographic Telepresence Environment Based on Cymatic Principles Oliver Gingrich, Alain Renaud, 
Eugenia Emets ABSTRACT KIMA is a holographic surround-sound installation that visualizes telepresence 
as both a phonetic and a synaesthetic phenomenon. The performance piece is based on the physical conditions 
of cymatics the study of physically visible sound wave patterns. Two environments, a quad surround and 
a holographic interface, build the framework of a telematic experience that illustrates communication 
as wave forms while focusing on the relationship between sound and matter. Project Description KIMA is 
an interactive art installation with multiple objectives: On the one hand, KIMA is designed to be a live 
performance that challenges conceptions of on-stage telepresence. On the other hand, KIMA is an interactive 
installation that can be explored by individuals. KIMA focuses on the intrinsic relationship between 
matter and sound, of the audio/visual. KIMA offers the chance to visually and phonetically experience 
how sound and image mutually influence each other, generate each other, and ultimately condition each 
other (Figure 1). KIMA is designed to be a user-independent installation. When not performed by live 
artists (a performer and a vocalist), it can be experienced by audiences as an explorative installation 
in which two users interact remotely creating a phonetic field alongside a holographic visualization 
of this soundscape. A user in space A creates sound through voice and movement to be transmitted and 
visualized in space B. The user in space B modifies not only the sound environment, but equally the cymatic 
patterns it generates. Sound is experienced as the essence of communication. On a perceptive level, KIMA 
presents the user with a new form of telepresent experience: Rather than focusing on photorealism in 
representation, KIMA looks at sound and matter as the bricks and mortar of communication. KIMA is last 
but not least a research project, designed to investigate the relationship between sound and visuals 
on a very basic physical level. Cymatics is known as the area of research on the effects of vibrations, 
and in particular sound frequencies, on matter. Cymatics as a science can be traced to Ernst Chladni 
s 18th-century experiments. With a team of sound designers, a physicist, artists, and programmers, KIMA 
builds on these explorations as a scientific framework for sound-matter interrelations. Technical Setup 
On a technical level, KIMA combines an unconventional screen interface a holographic screen with real-time 
motion capture input, mathematic sound visualization, and quad surround sound. Abstracting holographic 
telepresence as a visualization interface, sound becomes the primary layer of presence. In two remote 
setups one audio/visual, the other purely phonetic users experience actions and interactions as a sense 
of one another s presence. The soundscape of the first space is transmitted as holographic imagery into 
the second space, where it allows for real-time modulation of both vision and sound. Through methods 
of reflection and refraction, holographic screens allow for projection into space as opposed to onto 
a surface. Users can then interact with imagery generated in real time in this case, affecting both shape 
and sound. This shared soundscape is visually represented as a cymatic pattern on the holographic screen. 
Actions and movements in this space modify visuals and the soundscape in what becomes a perpetual feedback 
loop of communication. Technically, KIMA distinguishes itself from other telepresence art installations 
in concentrating solely on the relationship of sound and matter through motion tracking on a holographic 
screen interface. Pepper s Ghost-based telepresence interfaces allow for life-sized, spatial representations 
of human interaction. Through the principles of reflection and refraction, images are projected into 
the physical space as opposed to onto a surface allowing for onstage interaction with the visual form. 
This holographic representation (the perceived hologram ) appears as a life-sized image on stage to audience 
members in the auditorium. Overhead displays reference feedback streams for the presenter and the audience. 
As a spatial display technique, Pepper s Ghost projection serves as a platform for real-time communication 
(Figure 2). In KIMA, this telepresence solution is adapted to display the mathematical interpretations 
of a sound stream rather than a life-sized person. The stream is then modified through motion capture 
(Microsoft Kinect) in real time for a two-way telepresence interaction. Real-time-generated imagery is 
literally superimposed onto the performer and user. Real-time interaction between two spaces affects 
the shape of the structure, its spatial position, and the sound pattern it represents. This results in 
a perpetual interplay of communication. In its first rendition, KIMA was presented at Kinetica Art Fair 
London 2013, one of the UK s biggest forums for digital art staged as a performance between a vocalist 
and a dancer. The presence of the vocalist is almost tangible. The result of the dancer s actions is 
relayed as interference pattern back to the vocalist. Whereas the sound from space A creates visuals 
in space B, these visuals can be modified, translated, and redefined through the dancer s movements converging 
in an ever-changing joint telematic performance. Higher frequencies create different cymatic patterns, 
and the dynamic changes continuously through interaction. Conceptual Setup As a telepresence performance, 
KIMA explores new strategies in offering both a performance and an interactive user installation to audiences. 
In the tradition of telepresence art (Roy Ascott, Eduardo Kac, et al.), the act of remote communication 
is the core subject matter of KIMA, yet its focus is firmly on the intrinsic relationship between audio 
and visual. How does sound generate matter, what happens when sound modifies matter (for example, when 
we as humans act as instruments and create music with our movement and presence across spaces)? These 
questions are investigated both on an academic and artistic level. A number of artists have played with 
sound waves as either visible or invisible structures of communication. In 1970, Bernhard Leitner s Sound 
Cube used surround sound to immerse users in the experience of geometric sound, a walk-through audio 
architecture. David Bowen s tele-present water made use of water currents to deform a geometric structure 
at a remote location. Telepresence sound has been generated by Pauline Oliveros in her Deep Listening 
Institute since the 1990s. Other than previous telepresence pieces, sound isn t the sole focus of attention, 
but more of a modus operandi for the larger theme of remote communication. Sound is understood as one 
of many strategies of remote communication between two spaces. KIMA maps sound geometrically across two 
spaces, allowing the users to reference one another, to act as instruments within a composition they 
only partially influence. Performers or users thus form part of an ever-changing sound field that stands 
in the tradition of sound installation art (Wolf Vostell, Bill Fontana, et al.). KIMA understands sound 
patterns as part of a constantly changing force field that surrounds us, that we form part of the essence 
of communication. KIMA extrapolates this invisible environment by visualizing communication as real-time 
interactive interference patterns based on mathematical principles. In ancient Greek, kima means wave. 
In this telepresence environment, users experience the wave form in its sonic and physical forms as a 
traveling, continuously adapting stimulus as an interface of interactions. In contemporary art production, 
cymatics as visualization of phonetic waves have been the inspiration of artists around the globe. Telepresence 
art s long tradition dates back to 1983, when Roy Ascott staged La Plissure du Texte, and was further 
pioneered in the early 1990s (Paul Sermon [1], Tina Keane [2], Sommerer and Mignonneau [3] et al.). Recently, 
Paul Prudence BioAcousticPhenomena (2010) created visual references of cellular phenomena based on cymatic 
principles. 20Hz by Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt [4] is a sculpture generated by sound based on a geo-magnetic 
storm in the earth s atmosphere. KIMA was conceived as a telepresence depicting cymatic patterns on a 
holographic interface. This visible structure of wave patterns is a continuum of user/performer interactions 
via body and voice in space. The work is a comment on the phenomenon of presence itself, at sound as 
an interference pattern, an orchestration of communication rather than mere representation of sound. 
However, there is only limited available research on the intrinsic relationship between sound and visual 
telepresence. Academic research studies remain vague and inconclusive. With KIMA we attempt to fill this 
gap by providing a framework for future analysis of this specific aspect of telepresence. The work is 
distinguished from other telepresence installations in its specific focus on the intrinsic sound-matter 
relationship. Experiential Setup In KIMA, there are two types of communicative clues: On the one hand, 
users communicate with the space around them. They enter an invisible construct confined by the physical 
borders of the space every movement induces a change in this sonic environment of echoes, frequencies, 
and geometrical attributes. Whereas one space allows for phonetic references only, the second space depicts 
a cymatic representation of these sound patterns, abstracting the presence of the other as interference 
patterns of communication. The space itself and its exploration are central: Both performers are immersed 
in two distinctively prepared spaces, equipped with invisible sensors that enable navigation. A quad 
surround sound system provides feedback, and a holographic projection technology creates a volumetric 
sensation of light. Holographic screen displays use a transparent screen and methods of light reflection 
and refraction, thus allowing for the sensation of 3D without the need for 3D glasses. Employing visual 
cues and references that help to conjure the illusion of spatial depth perception, holographic screens 
map virtual information onto the real space creating a plane of onstage interactivity between virtual 
images and live performers in a controlled-light environment. A dark environment along with a controlled-lighting 
solution plays a key role in this optical illusion. By its very nature, a dark space engenders an immersive 
environment. How do we experience ourselves in such an environment once we sense another presence? On 
an experiential level, the dichotomy between you and me ceases to exist and gives way to an endless echo 
reverberating in both locations. In KIMA, information on the other presence is provided only through 
code coded representation of sound or sound patterns transcoded into feedback loops. It is through this 
deformation of communication, through a veil of self and other, that we experience information on spatiality. 
KIMA looks at invisible presence on two levels: quad surround sound feedback loops and a visual representation 
of these sound patterns on the holographic screen. On this holographic screen, KIMA plays with notions 
of visibility and invisibility. Cymatic patterns only become visible when sound is emitted, i.e. when 
communication takes place. Invisibility has been explored in contemporary art production and display. 
The Hayward Gallery s Invisible: Art about the Unseen, 1957 2012 was entirely dedicated to that theme. 
Jeppe Hein s Invisible Labyrinth (Centre Pompidou, 2005) explored architectonic presence through movement 
and sound relays [5]. In KIMA, the users remain almost invisible, as sound waves act as a medium of telepresence. 
Whereas one space allows for sound as the sole reference to the other s presence, the other space displays 
a visual structure a cymatic sound sculpture as representation of sound. Here, sound serves more as a 
prompter for cymatic effects an interface for further interaction. This representation of sound as particle 
waveforms in a holographic environment is based on the voice of the other in the second space. Exploring 
both spaces, users can physically experience the difference between sonic and visual presence. Holographic 
screen interfaces (here, a Musion Eyeliner screen) allow for spatial perception of visual information 
and for live onstage interaction with these visuals (in KIMA, via Microsoft Kinect). The Kinect camera 
traces z-depth information along with information on position, which serves as feedback to both Processing 
and Max/MSP scripts. Based on the principle of Pepper s Ghost, this creates an interface that can be 
experienced spatially. Any movement in this space creates further feedback both to the visual form on 
the display and the phonetic environment in both spaces. This cymatic telepresence setup can be performed 
(by professional performers) or simply explored. Both phenomena cymatics and telepresence have a long 
tradition in the visual arts, and both concepts have changed and evolved dramatically over time. The 
second communicative layer is the phonetic interaction with the other. Within the dark space, we almost 
expect to feel the other, yet we can only hear him or her exploring another space wherever that might 
be. Location references of the other are generated through sound panning and mapping to the user s own 
environment. Location cues are augmented through echoes, reverberation, and frequency changes, and the 
fact that all we hear, feel, or see are interference patterns of sound coincidences of communication. 
Following Paul Wazclawick s studies in communication [6], not to communicate is virtually impossible. 
In KIMA, users are constantly exposed to a stream of information generated by their environments and 
users that explore them. Immersed in the KIMA setup, users transcend the boundaries of the physical space 
to communicate with similar spaces through different patterns of communication. KIMA explores a new route 
in telepresence art by creating an interface for a new form of presence that concentrates entirely on 
sound and matter as the nucleus of communication. Processing code, whether displayed as cymatic pattern 
or purely audible, is based on the physical principles of cymatics wave patterns that result from sonic 
frequency changes. Mathematically correct formulas build the framework for visual references that emerge 
in real time as representations of the invisible. KIMA as synaesthetic experience remains within the 
conceptual framework of telepresence art, while focusing on the sound-matter relationship through cymatics. 
Conceptual Issues: Cymatics and Telepresence KIMA has three main conceptual frameworks: telepresence 
as a concept and art form, cymatics as a research subject and art practice alike, and, in a wider context, 
synaesthetic art. Telepresence As a concept, telepresence dates back to the 1980s when the term was coined 
by Marvin Minsky in his seminal article On Telepresence. Later conceptions focused on a mechanical telematics 
angle, aspects of virtual reality, and only in recent years on day-to-day communication. Minsky s techno-centric 
definition of the term gave way to proponents of a senso-motoric approach such as Thomas Sheridan s and 
ultimately focused on remote user experiences, such as the perceptual definition championed by the ISPR. 
The concept of telepresence relies heavily on the concept of remote presence a user-centric idea of perceived 
non-mediation. In art practice, pioneering experiments such as Paul Sermon s Think about the people now, 
which won the Golden Nica in 1991, were echoed by installations by Tina Keane, Julian Freud, and others 
through the 1990s and 2000s. Telepresence art has evolved dramatically from its early incarnation (La 
Plissure du Texte) through installations such as Ken Goldberg s Telegarden in the mid-1990s and Eduardo 
Kac s Ornitorrinco on the Moon in 1993. The more the internet started to dominate everyday life, the 
more telepresence art became popular. Raphael Lozano Hemmer s telepresence installation for Ars Electronica, 
Displaced Emperors (1997), shifted the focus from people to architectural telepresence environments. 
Sommerer and Mignonneau s The Interactive Plant Growing (1993) had a botanical, organic context. Over 
the last two decades, telepresence has found new channels in performance art, theater, and sculpture. 
In performance art, groups like Ghislaine Boddington s Body>Data>Space have experimented with new forms 
of telematic communication. In theater, the English National Theatre recently found a new outlet in telepresence 
performances by projecting plays live into cinemas across the UK. Telepresence sculptures represent a 
diverse spectrum, ranging from architectural art to classic sculptural forms. The architecture collective 
Assocreation connected two remote locations through a shared pneumatic floor interface with Bump in 2010 
[7]. Michael Takeo Magruder s Data Flower (2010) [8] presents a holographic sculpture as telepresence 
art the visual form of an ever-changing flower based on a perpetual live internet stream of news feeds. 
KIMA is a telepresence environment, a performative space, a sound installation, and a holographic sculpture 
a communication interface that allows users and performers to experience the spatial qualities of the 
physical space as a communicative infrastructure. KIMA s approach is new in that it shifts the focus 
from telepresence as remote representation to telepresence as audio/visual communication (Figure 3, 4). 
Cymatics The collective behind KIMA intends to use cymatic wave patterns in sound and image as a mediator 
for remote interactions. Cymatics, a terminology that derives from the Greek word ..µa (wave), is known 
as the science of visible sound waves the modal lines of particles or liquids within rigid environments 
as the result of sonic vibration. Ernst Chladni (1756 1827), the founder of acoustics, is known as the 
first to research vibrations and their effects on sand on rigid surfaces. Chladni demonstrated his famed 
laboratory setup at the French court and catalogued his studies to a certain degree. In the 1960s, these 
experiments were further developed and academically contextualized by the Swiss scientist Hans Jenny, 
who looked at regularities in visual patterns and established a formula linking frequencies to visual 
patterns directly. His research and publications form a catalogue or atlas of wave patterns that now 
presents the backbone for future research for academics, musicians, and artists. György Kepes, founder 
of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Derek Kverno 
and Jim Nolen at Davidson College; and Thomas Cooper at Temple University all published diverse research 
papers on the subject. Recently Lewis Sykes from the Manchester Institute for Research in Art and Design 
investigated the subject in artistic and theoretic practice [9]. On a mathematical level, cymatic patterns 
have been discussed by Stewart and Colwell (1939) [10], by Elmore and Head (1985) [11] and maybe most 
importantly by Paul Bourke, research associate professor at the University of Western Australia [12]. 
In layman s terms, Chladni s patterns look at the movement of sound over rigid surfaces, at the acceleration 
of sine waves in a constrained environment such as a rectangular or round plate. Vibration patterns depend 
largely on the frequency itself as well as the rigidity of the surface and its confining boundaries. 
Modal residues settle where the speed of these frequencies equals zero. These points of zero acceleration 
are generally ordered symmetric lines arranged toward the center. Researchers have applied this model 
to three-dimensional space. Cymatics have influenced artists and researchers alike. Looking at cymatic 
patterns on a plate or in a volumetric form means to look at the intrinsic relationship between sound 
and sight. A Chladni plate ultimately acts as a medium for two dimensions to interact, as a mirror of 
their relationship. For KIMA, this contextual framework has been informative on mathematical, phonetic, 
artistic, and academic levels. Synaesthetic Art Audio/visual art has a long-standing tradition in cymatics: 
On a phonetic and symphonic level, R. Pellegrino s studies on The Electronic Arts of Sound and Light 
(1983) [13] and Alvin Lucier s composition Queen of the South stand out as artistic interpretations of 
the subject. Lewis Skyes Augmented Tonoscope is a synaesthetic art project that concentrates on analog 
sound-matter visualizations [14]. In the arts, Carsten Nicolai s Milch (2000) and Graham Wakefield s 
Chladni 2D and 3D Max/Msp patches have touched on the field of cymatics. Experiments in synaesthesia, 
the relationship between sight and sound, go far beyond the arts and have been conducted in physics by 
Newton and in music by composers such as Louis Bertrand Castell over the centuries. In video and installation 
art, there is a long-standing tradition of experiments in synaesthesia spear-headed by Oskar Fischinger, 
Norman McLaren, John Whitney Sr. and Jr., and Mary Hallock-Greenwalt, whose color organs Sarabet and 
Nourathar were able to create sound while displaying correlating images at the same time. As part of 
this long tradition of audio/visual art, KIMA is an attempt to be more than an audio/visual instrument 
for the body. It is an instrument for two, a perpetual composition of synaesthesia, in which users become 
composers and choreographers and their interactions become visual symphonies. On an academic level, KIMA 
looks at how sound enhances telepresence experiences for individual users. Research on surround sound 
in telepresence setups to date is still relatively inconsistent (compare: Lombard &#38; Ditton, 1997) 
[14, 15]. Studies diverge on the question of whether immersive sound enhances telepresence effectively 
and, if so, how much. KIMA investigates this intrinsic relationship. To this end, the physical setup 
will build the basis for future research, to be followed up by an academic evaluation based on interviews 
and questionnaires. KIMA is conceptualized as an investigation in audio/visual interrelations, an investigation 
of the role of sound in telepresence and the relationship between the visual and the phonetic. KIMA Technical 
Setup KIMA has three main dimensions: A. Interactive immersive sound installation B. A motion control 
interface C. A visual interface We will discuss the installation in all three aspects: A. KIMA as an 
immersive sound environment. In KIMA, sound acts as the main communication interface between two spaces. 
On a technical level, the sound engine written in Max/MSP [16] and controlled via the Open Sound Control 
(OSC) protocol is the mediating application of the system. The sound engine also processes audio information 
and sends it via OSC [17] to control the visuals. This process creates feedback loops for both environments. 
The audio signals are routed as raw audio data via Jacktrip and the Jackaudio Server (Cáceres et al., 
2009) [18] over the network. Interpretation of this audio stream in Processing [19] is based on mathematical 
formulae of cymatics and sine wave functions of cymatics: u(x,y,t) = A * sin(Kx*x) * sin(Ky *y) * cos(w*t) 
In environment A, the audio is transmitted through contact microphones, capturing the low rumbling vibrations 
of the users in their space. A second condenser microphone communicates the conversations and noises 
emitted purposefully by the users. This sound signal is processed in real time over the network through 
Max/MSP and OSC into environment B. All sound sources of environments A and B are automatically mixed 
and streamed through an array of four speakers plus a subwoofer in environment A. At the same time, a 
flattened version in a two-channel mix is sent to environment B. In environment B, one contact microphone 
and one condenser microphone are installed to record ambience as well as user audio input for real-time 
transmission. Two individual streams are sent to a Max/MSP patch for the mixdown in the application. 
Users hear interference patterns in the two spaces, to which they are, of course, invited to respond 
in real time. Whereas environment A is set up as an immersive sound environment, environment B is equipped 
with a holographic projection system (Musion Eyeliner technology) to display cymatic wave patterns created 
in Processing along with stereo mixdown. Interference patterns are displayed both phonetically and visually 
as a materialization of communication. Sonic interactions create a sense of presence and dislocation, 
which results in an entirely new perception of environment, other, and self. The overall sound environment 
represents an extension of naturally occurring, ambient sound signals produced by the users, thereby 
reinforcing the feeling of immersion and the level of engagements for the users (Figure 5). B. KIMA as 
a motion capture interface: Motion information is used in environment B to record and capture the position 
of the user and map it to the panning of the sound environment. The user in environment A is therefore 
able to hear the sound in quad. Spatial information is transmitted in real time for the user in space 
A to interact with. Visuals in space B integrate motion information in the display script. Ergo space 
B acts as a visual playground, whereas space A consists of an immersive phonetic sculpture. C. KIMA as 
a visual interface: KIMA s visual display is programmed on the physical principles of cymatics: wave 
patterns created by different frequencies on rigid surfaces or inside a specified volume. The visual 
representation of interference patterns is based on mathematical formulae derived directly from the studies 
of wave patterns in contained spaces such as the Chladni plate. In line with existing studies on generative 
art, KIMA s visual interface follows a set of rules to make the visual representation easier to read 
and more intuitive to interact with. KIMA is based on mathematical formulae that derive directly from 
Hans Jenny s cymatics. Various studies in both generative art and complexity theory state that highly 
ordered systems reduce visual entropy [20]. KIMA s telepresence experience is based on a highly ordered 
system to reduce entropy. The following rules have been laid out by the KIMA collective: 1. KIMA is autonomous: 
The aim is to create a completely self-generative, autonomous, and self-relying structure (Figure 6). 
2. KIMA is cymatic: Both interfaces are based on principles of cymatics (sound creates and alters visual 
form). 3. KIMA is communicative: Interfer­ence patterns of communication are its visual and phonetic 
representation. 4. KIMA is more than the sum of its parts: It consists of wave forms and particles that 
form together in entropy (Figure 7). 5. KIMA is audio/visual: The color spectrum is related to frequencies; 
sound panning represents locations. 6. KIMA is immersive: Physical space is mapped to a phonetic space, 
and different effects are attributed to it. 7. KIMA is user-focused: Visually and phonetically, centers 
are mapped to XYZ-coordinates of users. 8. KIMA is generative: Audio loops entail repetition of the form. 
9. KIMA is interactive: Once you stop interacting, the structure disappears. 10. KIMA is communicative: 
The louder the signal, the more visible the structure becomes. 11. KIMA is responsive: The faster the 
user's movement, the faster the visual structure moves. 12. KIMA is iconographic: Structure is created 
around the center. 13. KIMA is predictable: Amplitude of sound waves controls particle emission. These 
guidelines illustrate the conceptual underpinnings of the KIMA code. KIMA is at once self-reliant and 
autonomous. Like any other generative art installation, it is based on physical principles and is rule-based. 
Interference patterns, the single economic denominator of user communication, are displayed as a visual 
representation. Users are turned into theremins musical instruments of a composition they can only influence 
but never solemnly direct. In this sense, KIMA is organised under Paul Watzlawick s premise of the impossibility 
of non-communication [21]. KIMA makes use of a holographic interface (the Musion screen), which in itself 
is based on Pepper s Ghost projection methods. KIMA - Conclusions KIMA has a dual agenda, being at once 
academic research and an art installation, as well as being a phonetic immersive environment and a visual 
sculpture. KIMA is a telepresence experiment that plays with new technology: a holographic display technique 
based on the principle of Pepper s Ghost and a coded, programmed sound environment. On an academic level, 
KIMA is at the basis of a research evaluation of the impact of immersive sound on telepresence. On an 
artistic level, it creates a performative space for the public to engage in. The research collective 
understands telepresence not as a communication technology (such as Skype or similar), but as a concept 
of presence in a remote location. KIMA is conceptualized as an immersive perceptive experience of communication. 
Stripped of a visual representation of the other, we experience communication as something that is surrounding 
our senses, omnipresent like the wave forms that cymatics generate. As a non-verbal, non-facial communication 
process across distance, KIMA invites the public to act as artist and create a phonetic environment that 
solemnly consists of communication. KIMA also questions the conceptual context it operates in. Generative 
art is understood as art that consists of an autonomous system based on rules that form intelligent design. 
In the case of KIMA, a plurality of rules forms the structure of communication. On a visual level, these 
rules are based on cymatic patterns. On a phonetic level, the rules are interference patterns. This system 
is autonomous, yet dependent on user interference, on human interactions. Generative art aims for an 
autopoietic system that once created acts independently of human interference. KIMA is a generative art 
project, yet it requires human interactions interference patterns of communication to come to life. In 
this sense, KIMA is both interactive art and a generative art project facilitated through telepresence. 
Generative art and interactive art are neighborly disciplines, yet clearly defined and demarcated across 
academic literature. KIMA tries to break with the conventions of this artificial dichotomy of terminologies 
in constituting a piece that can be attributed to both worlds (Figure 8). First and foremost, KIMA is 
a piece on communication and the impossibility of non-communication. It understands spaces as representative 
immersive environments, as visual and phonetic echoes generated and created through communication. It 
is also an exploration of telepresence, of the essence of sound in establishing a sense of presence, 
a sense of other. This mediation process is the subject matter of the installation. Standing in a long 
tradition of pioneers (Roy Ascott, Paul Sermon) of telepresence art, we look at spatial environments 
as being filled with waveforms of communication. KIMA extrapolates these waves both on a visual and phonetic 
level, and reduces communication to an act of engagement. In the next stages of project development, 
the research collective will focus on deeper exploration of cymatic aspects through research and realization 
of 3D variations of cymatic phenomena. Using the current model as a starting point, the aim is to create 
a more intuitive, flexible, and in a way more complex visual language for sound visualization, which 
would allow an even more immersive and fluid interaction experience. This development will proceed alongside 
experimentation both in the performance and installation setting with public participation. The collective 
plans to work with both voice and other instruments as sonic input for two-way communication. This will 
allow the project potentially to be used in the context of multi-instrument music performance in interaction 
with one or several dancers. References 1. Sermon, Paul, Telematic Dreaming, 1992. 2. Keane, Tina, Couch,

		<abstract>
			<par><![CDATA[<p><i>Null By Morse</i> is an installation artwork that incorporates a military signaling lamp and smartphones. A series of Morse messages is transmitted automatically by the signal lamp. The messages are drawn from the history of Morse and telegraphy. A custom app for iPhone and Android uses the phone's camera to identify the changing light levels of the lamp and the associated timings. The app then decodes the Morse and displays the message on the screen on top of the camera image. This paper discusses the artwork in relation to the following theoretical aspects: It contextualizes the position of smartphones in the history of optical communication. It proposes an approach to smartphones in media art that moves away from futurist perspectives whose fundamental approach is to seek to creatively exploit the latest features. Lastly, it discusses the interaction with the phone in the exhibition context in terms of slow technology.</p>]]></par>

 344 Null By Morse: Historical Optical Communication to Smartphones Tom Schofield ABSTRACT Null By Morse 
is an installation artwork that incorporates a military signaling lamp and smartphones. A series of Morse 
messages is transmitted automatically by the signal lamp. The messages are drawn from the history of 
Morse and telegraphy. A custom app for iPhone and Android uses the phone s camera to identify the changing 
light levels of the lamp and the associated timings. The app then decodes the Morse and displays the 
message on the screen on top of the camera image. This paper discusses the artwork in relation to the 
following theoretical aspects: It contextualizes the position of smartphones in the history of optical 
communication. It proposes an approach to smartphones in media art that moves away from futurist perspectives 
whose fundamental approach is to seek to creatively exploit the latest features. Lastly, it discusses 
the interaction with the phone in the exhibition context in terms of slow technology. Introduction Null 
By Morse (NBM) is an installation artwork that explores optical communication on smartphones with a media 
archaeological approach. Media archaeology is a loose term employed to cover recent scholarship that 
seeks to re-examine the material history of technology to better, or at least differently, inform our 
evaluations of the present. Alternate histories of suppressed, neglected, and forgotten media that do 
not point teleologically to the present media-cultural condition as their perfection. Dead ends, losers, 
and inventions that never made it into a material product have important stories to tell [1]. Recent 
work in this field has examined Japanese gramophone toys [2], shadow plays and Phantasmagoria [3], or 
whole histories of forgotten artefacts [4] to provoke new perspectives on Japanese family life in the 
interwar period, screen technologies, and a wide range of modern media, respectively. Approaches from 
slow technology [5] have also pointed to our quickly disinterested attitude to many day-to-day technologies 
and the consequences for both user experience and the environment. NBM re-codes modern technology to 
enact and perform historical media and combines this with a slow-paced interaction. The effect is calibrated 
to result in a slow and contemplative experience. This experience is built on and through the material 
presence of historical and contemporary artefacts. With NBM, I employ juxtaposition of two anachronistic 
pieces of technology (a vintage lamp and a high-tech smartphone and their associated modes of communication) 
to evoke a rich and fascinating series of historical events. By literally spelling out this history in 
its own visual language the dots and dashes of flashing lights NBM aims to underscore the influence of 
technological media on the way that humans are able to imagine new forms of communication. This short 
paper represents three main contributions: (i) to re-evaluate smartphones as part of the same discourse 
network [13] as early forms of optical communication, such as the Chappe Telegraph; (ii) to propose an 
alternative artistic approach to phone-based art that accepts failure as a part of innovation rather 
than focusing simply on ever-expanding technological affordances; and (iii) lastly, to consider the interaction 
with the installation phone in terms of theories of slow technology. Related Work The following three 
examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Morse code in both evoking histories of communication and provoking 
interactions within the public realm. NBM exploits these facets to draw attention to the rich material 
history of optical communication and the debt that contemporary technologies owe to early pioneers. Morse 
code has been employed in a number of art projects over the last 10 years. Klara Hobza s Morse Code Communication 
[6] began with 12 light bulbs, which she manually switched on and off in Morse code. Over a three-year 
period, she increased the number of bulbs and their visibility until, with 1,200 bulbs and a prominent 
position over the city, she began to receive messages back from residents. In 2004, Germaine Koh s Relay 
[7] caused room lights in Newcastle upon Tyne s Baltic art gallery to flash in Morse. The gallery s position 
next to a river with a rich industrial history supported Koh s statement that: the beacon merges early 
technologies for communication and navigation with some of the more contemporary methods by which information 
and desire flow [8]. Koh s work also caused local residents to believe that someone was trapped inside 
the building, and they called the police [9]. More recently, #CPHsignals [10] used a twitter-controlled 
signal lamp to communicate across Copenhagen s harbor in Morse (Figure 1). The project aimed to: connect 
the two sides of the harbour, that are geographically close but still feel disconnected. Furthermore, 
it [showcased] how communication between remote locations was achieved in the past, in the context of 
Copenhagen s maritime culture [11]. NBM diverges from the above works by explicitly drawing upon the 
language of telecommunication s history and juxtaposing it with a contemporary and high-tech medium. 
Technical and Installation Description NBM consists of two main parts: (i) an automatically controlled 
military signaling lamp, and (ii) a smartphone installed on a plinth (Figure 2). The phone s camera points 
toward the lamp. A QR code printed on the plinth provides a link for Android phone users to download 
a version of the app that is running on the installation phone. The lamp has been retrofitted; its original 
incandescent bulb has been replaced by an LED bulb designed for car sidelights, which was chosen to allow 
for faster transmission. The bulb s flashing is controlled with an arduino microcontroller [12]. A simple 
circuit uses a transistor to switch current on and off to the bulb. On the installation phone, an app 
that I developed uses the phone s camera to take measurements of pixel brightness. The area in which 
the brightness level is taken is defined by the user, who taps on the camera image over the lamp. The 
software uses the differing brightness levels to infer whether the lamp is on or off. The timing interval 
defines a dot, dash, inter-character or inter-word space. The app displays the messages it has received 
on the screen. Users can also download the app and use it in the gallery space on their own Android phones. 
Communication in Military History: Technologies of Optical Telegraphs and Telegraphy The use of signaling 
lamps marks only one installment in the varied material history of optical communication. Starting with 
signal fires and beacons, through the optical telegraph, including the Chappe model and maritime telegraphy, 
the history is tightly bound with the development of strategic military coordination. The Chappe telegraph 
used a series of wooden arm positions to relay encoded letters to the next telegraph, within sight of 
the first. The development of this optical telegraph eventually allowed Napoleon s army to manage logistical 
resources across the expanding French military conquests [13]. Fast forward 40 years or so, and the patchwork 
genesis of Morse code became imbricated with both art history and American civil conflict. Samuel Morse 
s failed ambitions as a salon painter diverted his career into that of an inventor at a time when the 
rumblings of war first between Mexico and the United States and subsequently between the North and South 
proved to be a financial stimulus for his new communication medium [14]. With NBM, I propose the smartphone 
as just one more development in this lineage. I further suggest that the very possibility of imagining 
smartphones, as well as many of the technical developments that make them possible, began in the early 
19th century. Given Samuel Morse s artistic ambitions, it is perhaps fitting that Morse code should acquire 
a second life in artworks as well as the military, maritime, and transport industries, all of which exploit 
its simple encoding system across different media. Kittler [15] maintained that epistemes (roughly defined 
as historically or culturally coherent areas of knowledge) are delineated technologically. By his thesis, 
we conceive of the continuity or congruence of objects, not simply because of the relationships between 
different discourses about them, but because they afford particular circumstances dependent on their 
materiality. Starting with the technological specificities of devices, such as the gramophone for instance, 
he discusses the effect on our capacity to hear and remember. In Kittler s epistemic terms, we belong 
to a discourse network made possible only because we can envision communication in ways that are indebted 
to pioneering early technologies. NBM reduces the smartphones capacity to receive messages to the purely 
optical, to visually make the point that they exist in this continuity of such proto-technologies. Trans-Media 
and Time Perhaps the defining factor of Morse code and the reason for its continued presence in the imaginations 
of artists and the hearts of hobbyists is its capacity to be easily and sometimes manually expressed 
in a variety of media. It has been documented [16] how the transition of Morse from markings on tape 
(dots and dashes in the visual realm) to audio (dits and dahs) was a side effect of the noisy workings 
of mechanical relays, which caused operators to hear messages before they read them. As marks on tape, 
the transmissions were not necessarily dependent on time; they could be received and read later. As audio 
signals, the transmission necessitates a live conversation, which effectively ties the receiver to the 
spot. This static modality was formative in conceiving the core interaction of NBM. As well as the difference 
between relying on time to differentiate one message symbol from the next compared to more complex single 
symbols sent one by one, there is a further technical possibility that was explored by early telegraph 
pioneers. The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph [17] (Figure 3) made use of a parallel system of five wires 
which, in combination, caused a needle to point to the appropriate letter. These differing systems of 
communication strongly resemble current serial and parallel systems, and with similarly counter-intuitive 
efficiencies. Parallel systems that have the potential to transmit several (usually eight) signals at 
the same time often turn out to be less efficient than serial systems because the increased complexity 
causes unexpected effects (such as interference). Similarly, Morse s telegraph succeeded because its 
design, while inefficient, was simple and adaptable. Such similarities are more than simply metaphors. 
NBM refers to these histories to demonstrate that the unbounded era of communication that has occurred 
since the internet and subsequent ubiquitous mobile connectivity exists through many continuities. Not 
only the notion of telepresence itself, but also the material circumstances that make it possible encoding, 
transmission, and network topology exist on a historical continuum marked by similarity more than dissonance. 
Apps and Futurism, Hubris and Failure if you succeed you will soon bask in glory [18] we have struck 
an iceberg, sinking Alongside the anachronistic coupling of the iPhone and vintage lamp, NBM exploits 
another dissonance that of hubris and failure. The messages relayed by the lamp are chosen as some of 
the most famous in the history of Morse and optical communication. The first of the above two quotes 
is drawn from an early experiment by the Chappe brothers. The second is from the distress call of the 
Titanic. Other messages in the installation include the famous What hath God Wrought from Samuel Morse 
s inauguration of the Washington to Baltimore telegraph line, and Torture, a message blinked by Commander 
Jeremiah Denton, who was shot down and held captive by the North Vietnamese in 1966 [19]. What is striking 
to even a casual observer of this history is the polarized nature of the messages between the hubristic 
declamations of the inventor and the terse and defeated tone of those using the code to announce defeat 
or plead for help. This opposition between hubris and failure is echoed in the tension between the use 
of an iPhone as the installation phone for the project and the history of technological failure attending 
media art [20]. Apple, which has a rarefied brand status in which it is now almost synonymous with American 
virtue [21], is almost a metonym for futurism. The company s 2011 message, It just works, repeatedly 
emphasized the infallibility and seamlessness of their technology [22]. As such, iPhones seem an incongruous 
medium for media art, whose own history has been described as that of a panacea that failed [23]. Technical 
and sometimes critical failure has been a persistent theme of computer- and electronic-based art at least 
since Burnham s 1970 exhibition Software at New York s Jewish Museum. Burnham himself suggests how the 
most successful examples of such art are those that deal with the absurdity and fallibility of the machine 
[24]. The experimental aspect of new-media art combined with the sometimes variable technical skills 
and training of its practitioners leads, regrettably, to artworks proving sometimes to be technically 
unreliable. This theme of failure finds celebration in the various glitch arts, such as Takeshi Murata 
s data moshing [25], which have become popular over the last five or 10 years. Such practices are, of 
course, pre-figured by early pioneers such as Nam June Paik [26], whose experimental work with broadcast 
technologies explored their technical limits with occasionally expensive consequences. Against a background 
of innovation and failure, NBM uses the iPhone as a rhetorical device to critique innovation for innovation 
s sake. The phone s reliability and associations with high tech are overturned as its technical complexity 
is reduced to a camera and a simple program. By recognizing failure and limitation as an integral part 
of innovation, we shift focus away from the notional and on to existing devices as we examine the technology 
we have for lessons to learn. Static Interaction and Slow Technology In the NBM installation, users approach 
the iPhone on the plinth. They pause and watch as the message is spelled out, letter by letter (Figures 
4 and 5). This takes time and sometimes fails as other visitors pass between the phone and the lamp. 
If they choose to download the app and try it for themselves, they must hold the phone pointing at the 
light source and stay reasonably still. This interaction requires concentration, and the slow speed of 
transmission gives users considerable time for reflection. Hallnäs and Redström state that all design 
with deep roots in art is concerned with amplifying the presence of things to make them into something 
more than efficient tools for specific, well-defined tasks [27]. NBM is concerned with embodying evocative 
statements about media history, not with efficiently communicating information. Hallnäs and Redström 
further describe how slow technology is design concerned with how we relate to the expression of technology 
itself as we use it to do certain things [28]. In NBM, what was previously seamlessly part of our environment 
is recoded to reveal the techno-historical conditions of the technology and its antecedents, as well 
as its implication in man-made disaster. Technology is expressing itself to reveal a sense of continuity 
in function and experience. Commentators in HCI and design have pointed out the Platonic tendency of 
modern design to think of ideas separately from objects, considering objects to be only derivative copies 
of primordial ideas [29]. NBM articulates a history that is based on the experiments of those who thought 
with their hands as well as their heads. The use of physical devices to demonstrate and enact this history 
recognizes the agency of those materials in a way that written discourse simply cannot. Conclusions and 
Future Work I have introduced Null By Morse, an artwork based on Morse signaling and smartphone technology, 
and described how smartphones fit into a continuum of networks that began with optical communication 
and continued through telegraphy into the 20th century. I have found similarities both in the systems 
of time-based serial or parallel communication and in the versatility of Morse as a protocol and smartphones 
as a medium. I have also discussed the creative and practical value in recognizing the tension between 
innovation and failure, suggesting this both as an avenue for artists to explore and as a realignment 
of our relationship to technology. Finally, I have described the capacity of slow technology to manifest 
these facets in experience. This last point I consider to be the metaphorical glue that holds the experience 
together for audiences in the exhibition space. The slow pace of NBM provides a degree of breathing room 
for audiences to reflect on both the evocative nature of the quotes being relayed and the communication 
process unfolding before them. The history of Morse and telegraphy in general has proved a rich and productive 
one for artists and historians. In other work in progress, I am exploring other aspects of this history 
in ways that I hope will be productive in generating new experiences for audiences and suggestions for 
interaction design. One particular avenue I am keen to exploit is the physical relationship in which 
humans, such as telegraph operators, mediated between the domains of human and machine communication, 
position themselves as a type of secondary interface through which one accesses the connected world.

 Ut Pictura Poesis: Drawing into Space David Griffin ABSTRACT In 1735, Leonard Euler presented a solution 
to the practical problem of whether a route could be plotted to cross each of seven bridges in Königsberg 
once. His negative solution used the simplest of mark-making strategies to resolve a conceptual problem. 
Euler did not actually cross the town s bridges, but used them to resolve questions of connectivity, 
after which diagrammatic representations can be seen as the restructuring of logical problems to allow 
for inductive reasoning, for fruitful application beyond theory. But what if such a working graphic has 
as its target something that is simply incomprehensible? What are the upper limits of the denotational 
logic of such diagrams? This paper presents a drawing-research project that tests the cognitive advantages 
of technical graphics by directly engaging with things that cannot be made easier to understand through 
their use. Introduction In describing this portfolio of drawings, and grounding the questions raised 
by their implementations, I will start by citing the cognitive psychologist William Ittelson, who usefully 
characterized a mark made as an artefact of human intention as decoupled from its real-world source [1]. 
Ittelson crucially reminds us in the same paper that the perception of markings is a pragmatic affair 
enmeshed in a complex of individual, social, and cultural processes, applied to the interpretation of 
forms that always underdetermine meanings [2]. The drawing research project discussed here shows the 
scholar s decoupling to be deeply and perversely problematic when mark and surface are impossible to 
feel, so to speak, in the hand, and when the thing or relationship being delineated is out of this world. 
In this paper, I describe a portfolio of three drawings, inscribed onto the sort of troubling contexts 
where technical graphics are widely used to regulate the under-determination of our readings, to attenuate 
the oscillations, so to speak, of our lived experience. I begin by simply describing the conditions of 
the making of these drawings, each of which adapts the conventions of some well-understood technical 
drawing system, to interrogate the capacities of these systems for representing ideas that are otherwise 
extremely difficult (never say impossible) to grasp, in the sense of our normal 2 metres/100 kilos expectations. 
I then provide some context in which the reader can consider disciplinary uses of drawing as a practice 
of thinking, beginning from the abundance of the sketch, which straddles disciplines of art and design 
in particular, moving to Euler s parsimonious nodes and edges, to anthropological studies at opposite 
ends of our recorded history, where notations are used to get a working handle on murky or incomplete 
information. Finally, I address technical and epistemological problems posed by the drawings, all of 
which belie the smallness of the project s graphical beginnings (Figure 1): a set of humble thumbnails 
that set this author/artist on the course of a kind of time-space drawing practice with rhetorical dimensions. 
They are vitally invisible drawings, with referents that are likely impossible to fully recognize, in 
spite of their illumination by proposed networks of lines of light, inscribed on spaces we can know only 
in conjecture. Drawing into space The first of the three drawings is a topological diagram consisting 
of a one-second-long laser burst, aimed at the centre of our Milky Way Galaxy. This single line has approximately 
300,000 kilometres of length, resulting from a series of questions related to orientation, distance, 
and other physical matters, in support of an event that will take one second to begin, and something 
on the order of 25,000 years to complete, assuming a definition for the word complete that allows room 
for the provisional. The second and much smaller (briefer?) drawing inscribes a network between our small 
planet, our mote of dust, and the other planetary bodies in our local physical space a metaphor, really, 
allowing us to extend our grasp to scales that are otherwise incomprehensible in the scales to which 
we are accustomed. This quasi-semantic diagram will actually connect us to those seven mythically charged 
bodies, for a period of time computed from the relative distances between us and them, beginning with 
the farthest and ending with the closest. This network will ultimately have the absurd property of around 
10 billion linear kilometres of length, tied ineluctably to about four hours of active drawing. The third 
drawing in the portfolio builds from the professional principles of multi-view orthographic projection, 
which is an analytical design-drawing method that constrains to sets of parallel views of a proposed 
object s sides. The multi-plane system, in its normal usage in industrial design, presents its users 
with a kind of totalized truncation: pictorial, in the sense of showing sets of true shapes and measured 
spatial relationships, but flattening and denuding them of visual detail, while mounting the inscription 
on an infinite parallel (indeed, impossible) orthogonal substructure. Reading from such a drawing, a 
fabricator can make the required object in accord with the compound needs of designer and client. As 
written, this rough description also identifies temporal and spatial dimensions, encoded through conventional 
adaptations: the drawings are spatialized images of distribution, in a time-factored multi-view format. 
In this final colossal drawing, three bisecting lines drawn through polar points on the planetary scale 
will form 12 wedges, flaring outward, amounting to another set of absurdities, delivered in the soft 
fiction of metaphor. The proposed graphics will have an existence that is actually dubious, qua Drawing, 
at least from the point of view of consumers of art production. But they will not be any less marks on 
surfaces than the object of connoisseurship under glass, in a frame, in exhibition on the walls of an 
art gallery. Further defining our terms, the art theorist John Willats has described a pictorial representation 
as mapping spaces out there to the page, while a diagram maps logical relations [3], but these peculiar 
drawings mapping space and time in conjunction operate somewhere between these two classic categories. 
They will physically span the dimensions they map in diagrammatic form, at once tracing and creasing, 
oddly re-coupling Ittelson s mark and surface. Drawing speculations I am a visual artist, so the small 
sketches in Figure 1 provided a sufficiently potent creative spark for the general parameters of this 
work to emerge. But the history that allows an understanding of the theoretical implications of those 
little marks began in 1735, when the mathematician Leonard Euler presented a solution to the problem 
of whether a route could be plotted to cross each of the town of Königsberg s seven bridges only once. 
Reviewing the town plan in schematic terms, Euler s negative solution showed how the scope of a conceptual 
problem can be investigated using only points and lines, the simplest of mark-making strategies. The 
mathematician s method, which manages both largeness and smallness of scales, led to a metonymically 
driven insight: Euler did not actually cross the bridges, but used them as characters in a denotational 
scheme, to resolve questions of connectivity, after which diagrammatic representations can be taken as 
a re-structuring of logical problems to allow for inductive reasoning, for fruitful application beyond 
the merely theoretical. This approach to graphical thinking has since become a critical tool in many 
fields, yielding methods for representing complex processes in the simplified, embodied-metaphorical 
terms of sequence and proximity. We now recognize that the structural simplicity of such diagrams exploits 
certain capabilities of the human visual system, displacing difficult logical, memory, and search requirements 
with a perceptually grounded context for making judgments [4], permitting views of relationships that 
are otherwise quite difficult to grasp, becoming therefore a kind of interface between intuition and 
interpretation; the diagram becomes both analysis and argument. More broadly, beyond the system and sequence 
analysis of nodes and edges, drawing has long been a core component practice for multiple disciplines, 
each of which benefits from the blended space of seeing, thinking, and making that happens on the page. 
A brief review of the capacities of drawing as speculative thinking practice is in order, and the sketch 
will be our key example. Sketching is a robust research method in creative disciplines, where the user 
plays with the very tics, hesitations, and flourishes of the act of drawing itself, in a search for salience. 
The sketch provides a haptic search space useful for conjecture, for testing against experiential knowledge 
[5, 6], and for provisional re-construction of what researcher Nigel Cross has called design s ill-defined 
problems [7]. But evidence of the speculative spirit of the sketch lingers even in those drawing methods 
that seek to communicate more explicitly. Two examples of this articulate, speculative use of drawing 
intriguingly share a disciplinary motivation (that is, to understand incomplete human stories), even 
as they bridge extreme ends of our recorded history as a species. First, in the anthropological research 
of Alexander Marshack [8], the scholar applied the terms time-factored and time-factoring to describe 
paleolithic marked artefacts, specifically the figures the researcher traced on bits of bone and stone, 
seeking their significance as early examples of notation. Marshack s study suggests that the early scribe-scientists 
who made them were not idly notching or decorating the bone bits, but were in fact drawing temporal sequences, 
placing marks over time, and in time, and reading relationships within them. Marshack sought to demonstrate 
that these mark-makers were in fact tracking the moon across the sky [9], using a simple marking system 
of tilted lines and notches as a proxy for knowledge of a passing thing that could not otherwise be grasped 
by its witnesses. And at the other end of our recorded history, in the profoundly collaborative practice 
of stratigraphy [10], archaeologists draw through their dig sites in order to arrive at plausible narratives 
which could account for those sites, relative to the current state of knowledge, creating spatial/temporal 
cross-sections directed at the telling of some fragment of larger stories. Wickstead notes that while 
a collection of photographs might provide more comprehensive documentation, those at work in the field 
attest to the superiority of drawing for their purpose. Wickstead writes: We draw contexts [11], description 
and interpretation coming together in the laying on of hands, and pencils. From a review of all of its 
instrumental uses, it becomes clear to those who study drawing that a primary motivation of the practice 
is measurement; this insight connects the haptic, emotionally loaded figure-drawing experience, with 
its loose gesturing between shoulder and paper, to more analytical systems such as projective orthography, 
or node-link diagrams, or the common music notation, with its oddly spatialized interval-scaling timeline 
and vertical pitch space. Across the range of my own mongrel artistic practices, I have identified this 
metric value in acts of representation of relationships between entities and forces, or a purely felt 
scaling of body to body. Of course, the measurement motivation has its most explicit application in geometrical 
drawing, suitably defined by the mathematician Felix Klein as working in a space together with a set 
of transformations of that space [12]. Geometric drawing is a visual-mathematical enquiry developed to 
take a measure of the field of sensible reality as a kind of wireframe accounting of dimension and incidence. 
The drawing itself enacts the principles it theorizes: the acts of construction literally can be said 
to have taken place [13]. Thus drawing allows inductive responses into the logic of a mathematical problem. 
Through work performed over external representations, then, our culture has moved from exploring natural 
principles in terms of location and change, as in Marshack s scribes, to the inscribed networks of computational 
visualizations, which allow sensate experience of a different kind of system, which is to say, information. 
Impractical drawings So if we take the generalized view of drawing as a vital (because simplest) cognitive 
assist, then what if a graphic, such as those that have been derived from Euler s ad hoc construction 
of nodes and edges, has as its target a thing that is simply incomprehensible in terms of the handfuls 
and footfalls to which we are naturally bound? What if we place node-link graphics in a space where their 
pragmatism is met by senselessness? The mark-making instrument used in these drawings will be the coherent 
light of LASER, here used for its linear values (that is, as lines of energy applied to the geometry 
of space itself as support, in a marking-up of unobtainable proportions). Such drawings must have multi-disciplinary 
entailments: in conversation with cosmological enquiries, they will become graphs writ large, equally 
measurable (from our earth-bound point of view) in temporal and spatial terms. Marschack pithily reminds 
us that the sky is a calendar [14], graphically capturing how we have come to use its apparent features 
for a kind of temporal-spatial codex. Of course the sky is really only a calendar when its features are 
drawn together by the mind s eye and, moreover, when it is then shown to us by the workings of graphite 
on some surface. And when those remote features become marks on a surface, they then enter into the call 
and response of symbolic exchange. We read them as metaphor, recognized in inchoate projections, and 
they become characters in a scheme. Despite these proposed drawings essential invisibility, through application 
onto the tangle of distortions and misunderstandings between what I know and what I do not, or cannot, 
know, witnesses to their making, in performance, will have an opportunity to examine intuition as a rational 
response to unreasonable quantities. At the very least, this portfolio provides experimental frameworks 
for discourse, but how are we to judge their success or failure as drawings? What is the relationship 
between such a drawing and its putative object? Entering into more flows of metaphor, where are these 
drawings? Where exactly is the centre of a galactic mass, here and now, and so long from the moment of 
the line s inscription? How long must each line be in order to form a continuous connection between us 
and any of our neighbors (a question with at least two correct answers)? What is the significance of 
an external representation we cannot interact with, not because it is hidden away, but because it is 
beyond us? Among other things, the very idea of scale and scaling in this portfolio is muddied, possibly 
beyond measure, and yet we might still seek refuge in a cascade of diagrammatic, numerical, and literary 
views, at least to make them legible for a mixed audience of artists and scientists. Finally, leaving 
aside any earth-bound obstructions (which are considerable, and which must be accounted for in their 
executions as drawings) we must answer questions about diffusion, or what might interfere with line formation 
and coherence in those spaces lying between the nodes of their enormous edges. Furthermore, what are 
the odds of such an occurrence? When and where is there a window of opportunity through which we might 
connect ourselves to all the planetary bodies on the same evening, for example, opening up the possibility 
of another conclusion devoutly to be wished: a multi-national, coordinated drawing activity? Ultimately, 
this peculiar recoupling of mark and surface may not find resolutions to the problems of their implementation, 
because if we can know anything in this particular problem space, we know that our bodily measures actually 
prohibit direct mappings of our experience onto structures at either end of cosmic scales [15]. We are 
prisoners of this incomprehension, so it is problematic even to apply metaphorical terms to the situation. 
Yet we also know that drawing practices play key roles in formal systems for recording and understanding 
relationships, from particle interactions to planetary orbits, to the elbows and hips of the life-drawing 
studio. Well after Euler s elegance, quantum theories in the physical sciences have presented us with 
infamously strange questions to be addressed. Crossing bridges, as that mathematician did without doing, 
is the least of our difficulties in this problem space. Key drawing practices have developed in response 
to those questions. In the visual modeling of quantum-physical knowledge, for example, Niels Bohr s graphical 
models posited projective diagrams of atomic motion in an orbital mode [16], while Richard Feynman s 
diagrams [17], seeking to map probabilities to the page, have proven themselves useful beyond the work 
in which they had their flush of first successes. The drawings in this portfolio interrogate the understood 
cognitive advantages of diagrams [18], inscribing what are surely the largest lines ever made in spaces 
about which we almost certainly know less than we think, asking after the upper limits of their denotational 
values. In drawing them, and seeing them drawn, we are forced to ask if connectivity is always a knowable 
state, even in the parsimony of diagrammatic reasoning. Seeking more questions, perhaps, than answers, 
this project offers collaborations between the abundance of artistic drawing and the deductive aims of 
the geometer. Finally, there is the sweet likelihood that, like the supernatural, otherworldly depictions 
of Renaissance painters, or even the indexical markings of modernist painting, our current state of knowledge 
is simply inadequate, which will reveal the project as a mere phantasm of a worldview. As a fine artist 
s drawing-research project, reaching around the rhetoric of Euler s graphic insights or the pragmatic 
productions of design-drawing, seeking knowledge which may not be possible to know, the drawings are 
marks on surfaces which are equally temporal and spatial. There will need to be a range of consultations 
undertaken, and, moreover, there must be a pragmatic recognition of impossibility built into this work. 
This futility I think reflects some measure of the general condition of representation, at least from 
the perspective of the painter or the poet (I am unable to speak for the cosmologist). Certain of my 
colleagues have suggested that they are rhetorical drawings, in the bad sense (is there such a sense?). 
While possibly true, this characterization nevertheless represents vexing questions with intriguingly 
unstable answers a condition to which any productive 21st-century art practice aspires. After all, they 
are not merely rhetorical. They will be drawn in fact, further confounding the meaning of that expression. 
As external representations with which we can only interact in the plan, they are free of aesthetics 
insofar as they cannot be directly apprehended, or at least not for long, and they are also free of use: 
they are not representative, cannot be exchanged, cannot exemplify or denote anything but some view of 
our own limitations. And, of course, they may be utterly wrong. The project will rely on technical and 
social interactions and communication, in support of gestures whose existence is equally a matter of 
time and space, and, moreover, of fantasy as a function. References 1. Ittelson, William H., Visual Perception

 The Electric Now Indigo Blue : Synthetic Color and Video Synthesis Circa 1969 Carolyn Kane ABSTRACT 
Circa 1969, a few talented electrical engineers and pioneering video artists built video synthesizers 
capable of generating luminous and abstract psychedelic colors that many believed to be cosmic and revolutionary, 
and in many ways they were. Drawing on archival materials from Boston s WGBH archives and New York s 
Electronics Arts Intermix, this paper analyzes this early history in the work of electronics engineer 
Eric Siegel and Nam June Paik s and Shuya Abe s Paik/Abe Video Synthesizer, built at WGBH in 1969. The 
images produced from these devices were, as Siegel puts it, akin to a psychic healing medium used to 
create mass cosmic consciousness, awakening higher levels of the mind, [and] bringing awareness of the 
soul. While such radical and cosmic unions have ultimately failed, these unique color technologies nonetheless 
laid the foundation for colorism in the history of electronic computer art. [With] television you re 
on the way to being a starchild inner and outer space become one in unknown velocities of a cosmic zoom 
 the now indigo blue of life merges with the glowing beauty of man at his most human ... -Ron Hays (1971) 
[1] Introduction In 1969, electronics engineer Eric Siegel asked: After a trying day, why can t the viewer 
 sit down at his TV set and listen to music while watching the screen burst with beautiful colorful displays? 
These visual phantasies, he explained, would relax you better than any tranquillizer and at the same 
time give your spirit a wonderful lift working through your audio-visual senses into your mind and soul 
[2]. Siegel was by no means alone. In 1970, Gene Youngblood wrote: Television will help us become more 
human. It will lead us closer to ourselves [3]. In their 1973 article, A Color Video Collaborative Process, 
artists Dan Sandin, Jim Wiseman, and Philip Lee Morton wrote: Central to our experience is the use of 
high technology as an adjunct to personal and spiritual growth [4]. Today these attitudes seem less optimistic 
than deluded, even a bit foolish. As contemporary television viewers consumers rather we know full well 
that the medium is commercially driven and seeped in fear-based content dealing in war, crime, scandal, 
horror, voyeurism, and atrocity occurring on global and local scales, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
punctuated only by brief commercials attempting to sell impossible fantasies. In the 21st century, television 
couldn t be further from the soulful embrace of the glowing beauty of man at his most human. But given 
the not-so-distant past of these views, and their sheer abundance, one wonders how such mystical notions 
of television ever seemed logical, let alone normative? How did a group of technically minded artists, 
in collaboration with engineers, immerse themselves in sophisticated and challenging technological environments 
only to turn out a genre of work that conjured spiritualism and a mystical beyond? This article seeks 
to provide an answer through an aesthetic analysis of color in analog video synthesis circa 1969 in the 
work of Eric Siegel and Nam June Paik. Eric Siegel s Generative Color Born in 1944, Eric Siegel attended 
high school in Brooklyn, and at age 13 he built his first TV set from scratch. In 1960, he won second 
prize in a science fair for a home-made closed circuit TV, a vacuum-tube device built from second-hand 
tubes and miscellaneous parts. The following year, he won yet another award: an honorable mention for 
his Color through Black and White TV. While Siegel was dyslexic, when it came to electronics, Woody Vasulka 
notes, he was clearly a whiz kid, and indeed, his contributions to the history of color in video synthesis 
are no less impressive. From the late 1960s on, Siegel built innovative electronic systems, including 
color synthesizers, which he used to produce psychedelic video artworks [5]. His Process Chrominance 
Synthesizer (PCS, 1968) was the first device capable of taking a black-and-white video signal from half-inch 
tape or elsewhere, such as a portapak, and transforming it to color through the video-synthesis process 
(Figure 1) [6]. Siegel used the PCS to create Psychedelavision in Color, a single-channel program consisting 
of Symphony of the Planets, Tomorrow Never Knows, and Einstine, first shown at Howard Wise s infamous 
1969 exhibition, TV as a Creative Medium. In the third piece, Einstine, the face of Albert Einstein is 
lit by rich oranges, purples, and magenta flames (Figure 2). For several minutes, the face shimmers and 
morphs into different hues, orchestrated to a Rimsky-Korsakov soundtrack. After viewing Siegel s Einstine, 
Woody Vasulka wrote: I always wonder why it took Eric to introduce this new image so convincingly. Something 
extraordinary happened when we saw that flaming face of Einstine at the end of the corridor. For us, 
something ominous, for me, something finally free of film [7]. Even while watching Einstine in 2012, 
something extraordinary still occurs: the colors, despite decades of degradation, are still rich and 
otherworldly, a testament to Siegel s truly unique color system. A closer look at the PCS helps explain 
how Siegel generated such awesome colors. The PCS is a colorizer, meaning that it can add color to a 
monochrome signal. In the US patent application for the PCS, Siegel explains the device s unique ability 
to provide a means for producing a color burst signal. A color burst signal is specific to analog video 
and television, a code used to monitor the synchronization of the color signal, or chrominance subcarriers, 
at the beginning ( back porch ) of each video signal [8]. In other words, Siegel introduced color information 
into a black-and-white signal by cleaning the incoming signal of any aberrations and then re-inserting 
a color-sync signal, adjusting its brightness, contrast (also known as gain ), luminance component (lightness), 
hue (color, also known as phase ), and saturation (also referred to as amplitude ). The PCS could then 
generate chromatic signals for the new subcarrier because it had a new pseudocolor (pseudo implies false 
or machine-generated) component added to the input source [9]. The result was an entirely new electronic 
color palette, in wild and beautiful palettes beyond FCC and NTSC broadcast standards. This beauty is 
again illustrated with Siegel s Electronic Video Synthesizer (EVS, 1970). The EVS was the world s first 
open-system analog electronic color synthesizer, an instrument for the creation of color visual information, 
Siegel explains, with the possibilities of at least one thousand different pattern variations [10]. The 
EVS could generate images independent of an input source (from film or other forms of optical media), 
though live camera input was possible. The abstract forms were produced using the system s own self-generated 
colors and free-form patch matrix pulled from an IBM card sorter with connections formed by mini-banana 
plug cables of adorable colors. The first circuit board was built inside a color television set. The 
processing amplifier ( proc amp ) generated a raw signal and provided it with a black level, blanking 
signal, burst signal, and sync pulse. (In analog video, the vertical blanking signal refers to the rate 
at which each scan line is rendered on screen, usually in a black burst or black wave used to coordinate 
the broadcast signal with the reception signal, known as the sync pulse. ) The EVS was built on BIC-VERO 
rack (a patch matrix board) with front knobs and switches that could be used to track changes on a monitor 
in real time. By manipulating the knobs, a wide variety of patterns, colors, and motions could be created 
[11]. These technical details, while likely obscure to contemporary readers, nonetheless illustrate the 
technical challenges circa 1969: what had to be mastered in order to get any color, let alone colors 
of an almost unbelievable intensity and richness. Siegel s colors, as noted, continue to appear magical, 
even on degraded videotapes seen 40 years later. He developed a color system that could, unlike others 
at the time, activate the phosphors on the TV tube directly, without the intervention of a video camera. 
That is, they utilized the full potential of the CRT tube which the camera did not do because most analog 
video signals were at the time AC-coupled, meaning both AC and DC circuits were connected (the latter 
blocked by the former) to produce signals that were highly inaccurate and resulted in an incorrect brightness 
level on the TV screen [12]. Both synthesizers (the PCS and the EVS) point to the advent of the historical 
distinction between images produced by optical and indexical media like film or photography, versus those 
produced post-optically, through synthetic and informatic means, such as computer-generated imagery. 
The former bears a causal link between event and image artifact: a photograph is a literal sample of 
light from a particular historical moment. With electronic visual media, this link is broken. To put 
it differently, any image that appeared from the EVS or PCS did so only through the synthetic generative 
processes, ex nihilo, and thus they were not only free of film as Vasulka puts it, but also, of optical 
media, and therefore natural vision altogether. Herein lies one rationale to understand how electronic 
color in video synthesis became magical and otherworldly: it literally was. WGBH &#38; the New Television 
Workshop Since 1951, WGBH has been a non-profit, education-based, public radio station based in Boston. 
In 1955 they incorporated the public television channel two to become the first non-profit television 
station in New England and a pioneer in public television. In the early years, the studio was full of 
Harvard guys who produced boring, black and white television. But this all changed in 1958 when visionary 
producer and director Fred Barzyk arrived and began experimenting, pushing the studio s envelope [13]. 
In 1967, WGBH transitioned to color, and new video switches arrived at the studio. The switches were 
capable of basic chromakey (the process of removing a color from an image so that another image element 
may replace it) and titling effects. Artists interested in the new but still expensive media were drawn 
to WGBH s artist-in-residence program, the New Television Workshop (1972 1992). The workshop was supported 
by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Ford Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, 
and from it emerged many pieces central to the history of video art. Early artists in residence included 
Nam June Paik, Stan VanDerBeek, Max Almy, Douglas Davis, Peter Campus, Trisha Brown, Ed Emshwiller, and 
William Wegman. Fred Barzyk oversaw the New Television Workshop for 10 years, during which time he watched, 
invited, and experimented with hundreds of artists who flowed in and out of the studio, all enthusiastic 
and eager to pioneer a new genre of electronic art (Figure 3). But even before artists arrived at the 
New Television Workshop, Barzyk and his WGBH colleague, director David Atwood, were broadcasting experimental 
programs. In the mid 1960s, Atwood recalls, we started doing these light shows where we just did whatever 
came into our head. We mixed black-and-white cameras with telecameras, light show images, and then feedback 
 [we] broke all the rules [14]. At the time, Barzyk and Atwood saw themselves as directors fooling around 
with TV: in hopes of making a change and bringing out the 60s feel to some of our shows on public television 
[15]. After realizing the vast possibilities for video in this relatively open-minded setting, they got 
a grant, and the doors opened. Most doors opened. Those behind the doors to management and on the executive 
level viewed the incoming artists as a disaster waiting to happen, and after Paik s early residences 
at WGBH it is hard to argue with them. At the same time, the wild and unruly experiments that Paik conducted 
at WGBH (noted below) are today heralded as cornerstones in the history of video and electronic art, 
which add esteem to the WGBH name. WGBH s national broadcast of The Medium is the Medium in March of 
1969 featured the work of six artists: Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Otto Piene, James Seawright, Thomas 
Tadlock, and Aldo Tambellini, each of whom made a short video using WGBH equipment. By far the most controversial 
contribution came from Paik with his Electronic Opera #1 (Figure 4). For the segment, he brought a dozen 
prepared televisions into the studio, used three color cameras to mix the images with a nude dancer, 
tape delays, and positive-negative image reversals. Paik s Opera, as Youngblood puts it, consisted of 
dazzling silver sparks against emerald gaseous clouds; rainbow-hued Lissajous figures [which] revolved 
placidly over a close-up of two lovers kissing in negative colors; images of Richard Nixon and other 
personalities in warped perspectives [which] alternated with equally warped hippies. The piece was set 
to the soundtrack of the Moonlight Sonata, interrupted periodically by Paik, who looked at viewers, yawned, 
and announced, Life is boring. He instructed them to close one eye or close one eye halfway and finally, 
turn off your television set [16]. The Opera was controversial for its strange technical setup and unorthodox 
use of Nixon s head twisting through synthetic video effects, but above all, because it featured a topless 
dancer. The dancer was supplied by a WGBH type, Atwood explains, who had connections everywhere in Boston. 
We never knew from where she came and never asked. She showed up, took off all but panties, stood on 
a pedestal, was directed by Paik, was recorded, and left [It] was a minor scandal at the time. A topless 
dancer was definitely not what the station expected or hoped to see from a show on the arts. But at this 
point the show was already receiving national recognition and strong support from the Ford Foundation, 
so the studio (reluctantly) honored such requests [17]. After The Medium is the Medium, the Rockefeller 
program was created, and Paik returned to Boston as a full-time artist in residence. After the studio 
made the transition to color in 1967, a new financial arrangement mandated everyone to pay for studio 
time. This became expensive, because with color, the set-up time multiplied exponentially, and it would 
take all day to get it right, whereas with black and white, they would be ready to go in minutes [18]. 
Frustrated with this, in 1970 Nam June Paik set out to create a low-cost alternative, a color manipulation 
system that resulted in the Paik-Abe Video Synthesizer (PAVS). The Paik-Abe Video Synthesizer Initially 
dubbed The Wobbulator, the PAVS was a homegrown project engineered by Paik and his childhood friend and 
engineer Shuya Abe (Figure 5). They built the PAVS from the ground up with limited financial resources. 
The budget from WGBH was $10,000, which included airfare to and from Japan. In the haphazard and scavenger 
style that came to define him, Paik built the system using second-hand wires, television sets, and hardware 
parts (a method that stands in stark contrast with Siegel s systematic control and organization of every 
color and function). Barzyk recalls finding Paik setting up in the studio one day wearing tall rubber 
boots. Upon inquiry, Paik explained: If I don t wear them, I get electrocuted [19]. For special effects, 
Paik sought low-cost, highly creative alternatives. He bought all manner of crap, Atwood says, plastic 
dishes, cheap busts of famous composers, and anything plastic that cost nothing and would distort light. 
He even used a record turntable to construct and spin objects at either 33 rpm or 78 rpm. Barzyk once 
found a mound of shaving cream whirling around on top. A roommate of Paik s recalls he even made his 
own bed out of old console TVs with a mattress placed on top. He ate off disposable paper plates and 
used plastic utensils, which he cited as the greatest American invention. Paik s style was fast, cheap, 
and messy, but effective: under the studio lighting, the rotating shaving cream transformed into a mélange 
of color and images [20]. On August 1, 1970, the PAVS embarked on its maiden voyage on channel 44 in 
a four-hour debut called Video Commune: The Beatles From Beginning to End, a broadcast of far out imagery 
never before seen by the world. The Commune featured a variety of images, such as Japanese television 
commercials remixed through the synthesizer and set to the Beatles soundtrack, providing at least one 
element of continuity in an otherwise unstructured visual spectacle. While Video Commune marked a milestone 
in the transformation of broadcast television, using the PAVS, let alone controlling it, was another 
issue altogether. Even Paik admits the PAVS was a technical nightmare. It s a sloppy machine Paik said, 
like me, and Atwood concurs: it was a miracle that it even made an image. The WGBH engineers, who sat 
at the mixers and switchboards in the control room, loathed the PAVS even more, just as they abhorred 
the ways in which the artists incorrectly used the expensive studio equipment ( holding down three and 
four buttons at once, a [Cagean] method that had the engineers in agony ) [21]. There was also a time 
when, during the PAVS s debut on channel 44, it burned up the studio s very expensive chromo filter transmitter. 
Paik had simply ignored FCC color limits, which is also to say he neglected to run his colors through 
the vector scope and compress them. Eventually, Paik saw value in the vector scope and, after he left 
WGBH in the early 1970s, artist Ron Hays arrived and developed a systematic method for controlling color 
and image synthesis patterns with the PAVS. The End of the Liquid Rainbow By the late 1970s, these wild 
and psychedelic color experiments had been harnessed for stable commercial applications. Nonetheless, 
the colorful world of video synthesis circa 1969, illustrated above in the work of Paik and Siegel, was 
one of transcendental immersions and cosmic union between humans and machines, and this world, it must 
not be forgotten, created the groundwork for a future of vibrant electronic art. In sum, while the mystical 
video synthesis produced in the late 1960s and the early 1970s may have seemed misguided, given the radically 
new and unstandardized technology, the utterly alien color palettes these pioneers generated, the relatively 
free and unfettered experimental approach to the work, and progressive cultural contexts that bolstered 
them, these mystical and utopic visions should now seem grounded by material fact. The now-indigo blue 
of video synthesis symbolized an equipment-free aspect of reality that Walter Benjamin once identified 
as the blue flower in the land of technology [22], a revolutionary hue that could only appear, circa 
1969, if televised. References 1. Hays, Ron, Music &#38; Video Feedback/Video Light, unpublished technical

 The Emergence and Growth of Evolutionary Art 1980 1993 Nicholas Lambert, William Latham, Frederic Fol 
Leymarie ABSTRACT One of the most interesting if frustrating aspects of charting the history of computer 
art is trying to understand the intersections of specific technologies and artistic experimentation. 
It is rarely as clear-cut as a simple linear influence of one to the other, partly because artists are 
able to envision all kinds of possibilities that technology might enable them to realize in some kind 
of form, but as they do so, the technology is itself shaped, especially in terms of how it is perceived 
by others. Do artists find a way to give technologies an aesthetic outlet, or do some technologies possess 
or facilitate a characteristic aesthetic that finds its expression through specific artists? Certainly, 
in the history of computer art it would seem that particular aesthetics, technologies, and artists are 
closely intertwined in certain periods. This intertwining of art, technology, and ideas stolen from the 
natural world has never been so arguably merged as the period in the history of computer art from 1980 
to 1993. We take as the defining start of this period the initial work of Mandelbrot on fractals that 
became known as the Mandelbrot set and led to his famous illustrated art-science book The Fractal Geometry 
of Nature. In 1993, this first highly creative period in evolutionary computer art came to an end with 
major publications by pioneers Karl Sims, Stephen Todd, and William Latham. Artist-Researchers and New 
Graphics Technologies in the 1980s Although the emergence of personal computers by 1980 enabled a new 
generation of artists to start experimenting with digital images, especially due to the Apple Mac, Commodore 
Amiga, and Atari ST, in 1984 85, as advanced graphics and sound capabilities became available, there 
were those who continued to be closely associated with academic and corporate research centres. The Xerox 
PARC model was undoubtedly influential in providing a template for research collaborations, and IBM in 
particular supported some interesting developments. In such environments, artists could leverage the 
power of multiple networked computers, use software that was still under development, and utilize video 
displays and printers that were far more advanced than those available elsewhere. The emergence of computer 
graphics as a major aspect of commercial TV and film production, in addition to its use for scientific 
visualizations and military simulators, drove the development of new graphics technologies. One key area 
was the simulation of natural landforms, vegetation, seascapes, and other environmental features. Hitherto, 
the public perception of computer graphics (as represented in films such as Tron and War Games ) had 
been of vector 3D shapes and textured solid models. However, during the 1980s, a new and increasingly 
ubiquitous image appeared: the fractal, a word coined by Benoit Mandelbrot and visualized as the Mandelbrot 
set [1, 2]. This radically changed the idea that computer graphics had to look artificial; along with 
other techniques, it raised the possibility of simulating the natural world. Mandelbrot himself referred 
to the collision of abstraction and naturalism that occurred when fractals were first used by Richard 
Voss and others to generate landscapes: What a profound irony that this new geometry, which everyone 
seems spontaneously to describe as baroque and organic , should owe its birth to an unexpected but profound 
new match between those two symbols of the inhuman, the dry, and the technical: namely, between mathematics 
and the computer [3]. Such a possibility had actually been raised back in the early 1950s by Alan Turing 
himself [4]. Fascinated as he was by the symmetries and structures produced by organisms, he realized 
he could investigate the area of morphogenesis using the new Ferranti computer. Unfortunately, his death 
occurred in the middle of this ground-breaking work, and his thoughts on evolutionary systems cannot 
be deduced from his surviving notes. Yet he pre-empted a whole area of biological and genetic research 
in the 1980s that was also preceded by John Conway s Game of Life [5]. It was The Blind Watchmaker by 
biologist Richard Dawkins that inspired the first true flourishing of artificial life (A-Life) in the 
computational medium, and crucially gave rise to a number of aesthetic innovations [6]. Dawkins named 
the new emergent forms after the surrealist paintings made by Desmond Morris that contained vaguely animal-like 
shapes, which Morris described as biomorphs [7]. Dawkins created genetic rules for each tree that enabled 
them to mutate as different lineages were bred together. He made the tree-like forms symmetrical about 
their vertical axis for reasons of parsimony and aesthetics, as well as because [he] was hoping to evolve 
animal-like shapes, and most animal bodies are pretty symmetrical [8]. Dawkins noted that despite experimenting 
with other growth patterns, the symmetrical plan generated the most interesting, and indeed lifelike, 
results. This was a lucky outcome, but later Dawkins deliberately added genes to control the segmentation 
of the forms, mirroring the importance of segmented bodies in the animal kingdom [9]. With segmentation 
and symmetry combined, the resulting forms had the greatest diversity and therefore fitness. Yet the 
original decision was fortuitous, and the outcomes truly emergent. It would seem that both Dawkins and 
Mandelbrot, though scientists by training and vocation, were well aware of the aesthetic potentials of 
their discoveries. In Mandelbrot s case, the similarities with natural forms were striking and obvious, 
especially after they were applied to textures and landscapes in 3D programs by Alan Norton and others 
[10]. However, Dawkins evolutionary forms would encounter the work of an artist already immersed in the 
concepts of mutation and generation. The Early Computer Artworks of William Latham William Latham started 
working with computers in 1985 after completing his MA degree in fine art at The Royal College of Art 
in London. At an early stage in his career, he took the concept of evolving forms and freely developed 
it into a distinctive artistic style, which incorporates natural and artificial elements. Latham is also 
interesting for having gradually moved away from art in 1993 and into computer games, which incorporate 
ideas and code taken from his earlier art work. Latham was interested in the evolution of form even before 
he discovered computing. "During the period 1983 to 1985, using a set of rules, he designed and termed 
FormSynth, for the transformation of shapes, he set out to sketch huge drawings of multiplying, changing 
forms (Figure 1). The logic and consistency of Latham s possible worlds arises from his concept of an 
evolutionary approach to the making of sculpture. The complexity and vitality of the forms he devised 
is derived from the step-by-step accretion of operations on simple initial forms such as cones, spheres, 
or tori [11]. John Lansdown, in his introduction to The Conquest of Form , Latham s 1989 exhibition at 
the Arnolfini in Bristol, UK, considered that Latham and others working with him (in particular Stephen 
Todd and Mike King) were exponents of another form of sculpture [12]. This is derived from the illusory 
yet real appearance of these works: their seeming materiality is defeated by the obvious departures from 
our physical reality (Figure 2). Even this system could produce unexpected results [13]. In 1987, Latham 
was appointed artist and research Fellow at IBM s UK Research Labs in Winchester, where he began working 
with mathematician and programmer Stephen Todd on a system called FormGrow. This built on FormSynth and 
allowed simple construction rules such as bulging and hollowing objects. As he worked with this system, 
building up a new library of rules, Latham realized that some of his long repeated sequences of FormSynth 
operations could be condensed into new rules, such as those for growing tendrils and horns. Later on, 
by the end of 1988, Latham and Todd started using an add on new system they developed, called Mutator, 
that managed the data from FormGrow and began to cross-breed forms together, by identifying their basic 
components as genes and allowing these to be recombined and modified to produce large evolutionary trees 
of computer-generated imaginative 3D forms (Figure 2). As Latham says: Mutator derives its methods from 
processes of nature, and was partly inspired by a simulation of natural selection [14]. Importantly, 
the Mutator system enabled the artist to pick, breed, and marry natural-looking forms at will based on 
their aesthetic quality, which gave the artist a highly intuitive and minimal interface. This system 
has an overall appearance that could be called organic and seemingly aims toward natural yet fantastical 
forms. Latham s stylistic decision on which operations to use was made at the level of the core design 
of the program itself, ensuring that all images bear his imprint, to a degree. The aesthetic of these 
images, while inspired by nature and science-fiction, remains very much their own. These are forms that 
would have been inconceivable without the computer to perform all the millions of possible changes, transformations 
and developments that Latham foresaw (Figure 3). One might justifiably question the artist s role in 
images that are not merely assembled by the computer in its capacity as a tool, but generated directly 
by it. Where is the human input? Latham counters that his input is at the level of the software itself, 
which imparts not only the formal construction of the objects but also more intangible aspects of their 
style as well. Latham s major influences are science-fiction imagery one is reminded especially of H.R. 
Giger s designs for the Alien films [15] and the seminal book On Growth and Form by biologist D Arcy 
Thompson, which revealed the mathematical structure underpinning the shapes of life forms [16]. By shaping 
the code that in turn creates the images, Latham s involvement is at the conceptual rather than practically 
artistic level, though he also exercises further artistic judgment in choosing certain paths for his 
images to grow and develop, and their final visual quality in terms of color and texture. Karl Sims and 
Artificial Life Although Richard Dawkins had given impetus to simulations of evolution, it was not until 
Dawkins himself introduced his Biomorphs that a number of major figures in this emerging area, including 
Karl Sims, began developing their own concepts [17]. From this, Sims developed a program that used the 
basic genetic concepts of selection, reproduction, and sexual combination to evolve an artificial genotype, 
and in so doing represent the Darwinian idea of fitness in action (Figure 4). A-Life, then, is fundamentally 
concerned with understanding and formalizing the underlying dynamic structures of living things [18]. 
A-Life art, defined in the simple sense outlined above, engages with the same ideas: it is a form of 
art practice that begins to take on, in various ways, the abstract dynamics of nature. In terms of the 
creative process, both Sims and Latham primarily use the human as a cost function in a Monte Carlo-type 
simulation to explore a multi-dimensional parameter space in which the unevenness of parameter space 
is covered. Interestingly, during this period, the use of constraints played a small role, apart from 
individual mutate-able parameters with maximum and minimum values and the implicit constraints of Sims 
Lisp Code and Latham s FormGrow logic. In addition, the automatic culling of generated forms (based on 
mathematical criteria) to reduce the size of the search space was limited. Replacing the artist (as a 
fitness function selector) was also very limited. In his 2001 essay that considers the origins of A-Life 
and art, Mitchell Whitelaw points to a 1987 seminar by Christopher Langton in Los Angeles as the starting 
point for this area. Looking for precedents in art for the concept of artificial biology, he points to 
Goethe s analogies between living creatures and works of art, and Klee s understanding of his picture 
plane as a kind of contained, artificial world [19]. Whitelaw also points to Kasimir Malevich s Suprematism, 
which, although it renounced realistic and imitative painting, viewed the pictorial image as an object 
in its own right: a work of pure, living art, as Malevich put it. Malevich also considered a machine 
to be a technical organism and used similar biological metaphors for technology [20]. An Evolutionary 
Aesthetic? Do new aesthetic forms in digital art depend on an understanding of the software and programming? 
Latham, of course, worked extensively with programmers, but he arrived at the computer with a strong 
sense of process in art. His evolutionary sketches show a means of deploying form in an evolutionary 
methodology. Because he had been interested in evolving forms even before he used computers, he was able 
to apply the most distinctive computer quality of all: the modelling of dynamic processes. These artistic 
systems are not wholly deterministic, running an image through pre-set parameters until it reaches perfection. 
Indeed, Latham realized early on that the most interesting outcomes of his program were quite unforeseen 
by him: his evolutionary program could arrive at unexpected conclusions. Even if an artist programs the 
computer from the start, there will always be an important element of mystery in the working of the software. 
Such quirks render the computer less mechanistic (and predictable) and more artistic, because the outcome 
of certain operations cannot always be foreseen. This unpredictability can be harnessed in the same way 
as the chemical reactions of pigments, or the densities of stone. In other words, an artist develops 
a feel for its working and gradually incorporates its idiosyncrasies into their work, which itself changes 
subtly or overtly to accommodate these properties. This is evident in FormSynth and Mutator, where Latham 
s choice of operations performed on the initial shapes guided their eventual appearance. Latham s stylistic 
involvement was, in a sense, pre-visual; it affected the starting point and development of all images 
generated through the program rather than just a single artwork. Although he modified of the program 
s underlying code, there were visual consequences because in this way Latham determined the visual environment 
in which his shapes could develop. Latham compared the artist to a gardener who guides the growth of 
a plant but is not the source of its life. This is itself a new development for art [21]. Mitchell Whitelaw 
sees in this a factor that is identified in a more general sense as the artist s signature or style, 
because the formal vocabulary of elements and transformations that takes place in Latham s work gives 
it a distinctive visual form. However from a purely exploratory, even scientific, perspective in terms 
of A-Life, it is also a limitation. The selection Latham exercises is primarily an aesthetic one that 
gives a non-natural aspect to the genetics of his work [22]. Latham s Organic Art images are the product 
of evolutionary processes and thus indirect products of his artistic vision. They are indirect in the 
sense that Latham developed the program to evolve shapes along particular visual lines, but its continued 
operation is not dependent on his intervention. Like Harold Cohen s AARON simulated painting program 
[23], the widely distributed Organic Art software could continue to create Lathamesque images long after 
his demise, with varying inputs and changes from computer users. The encoding of his evolutionary process 
in software allowed him to make it portable and then distribute it widely as digital code. Again, this 
widely distributed software may produce images not directly conceived by the artist, but the images will 
be inherent within the parameters of the software. Latham is responsible for assembling these elements 
according to his vision and requirements, but the final image is the result of the software s own working 
through these possibilities. Unlike AARON, however, with its complex relation to Cohen s creative input, 
Latham s software has a straightforward input procedure and generates images from his initial input parameters. 
AARON is not so straightforwardly instructed; it seemingly derives its own decisions about what to draw 
from its understanding of art. There are two different forces at work here. Firstly, there is the artist 
s control exercised by writing or mastering the appropriate software to create images. Secondly, there 
is the serendipitous aspect of accidental discovery inherent in an open-ended program where absolute 
control yields to experimentation and chance discoveries. In Latham s work, the evolutionary nature is 
the result of a programmer s control in setting up the initial conditions, then exercising further choice 
over the outcomes of these experiments. A fascination with growth and artificial, yet naturalistic, forms 
is essential to his art. Conclusion The period from 1980 to 1993 was initially dominated by fractal art 
led by Benoit Mandelbrot, followed by radical developments in evolutionary art as the impact of mutation 
systems such as Dawkins Biomorphs gained momentum with a number of key evolutionary art figures such 
as Karl Sims and the Latham-Todd tandem, whose work was shown extensively at SIGGRAPH during the period 
from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. These evolutionary artists were able to define core rules for 
growth of computer graphic forms and then use a mutation system that enabled them to pick and breed purely 
based on aesthetics to rapidly explore vast areas of multidimensional parameter space, not knowing what 
they would discover. Importantly this work enabled highly intuitive and artist-friendly interfaces to 
be developed with the addition of cross-breeding to zoom in on pleasing emerging outcomes. In parallel 
to this emergence of evolutionary art using computers, related work was being done through the 1980s 
in other scientific and technological areas. In the area of perception and computer vision, Michael Leyton 
was, for example, exploring the representation of shapes as processes that transform them, generating 
a plausible causal explanation for their history [24], a concept very much akin to Latham s own thinking 
in his development of the FormSynth system. In the area of the computer simulation of plant development, 
the use of procedural graphics combined with rule-based L-systems was becoming mature, building from 
the early works of biologist Aristid Lindenmayer [25]. Also in parallel, rapid developments were occurring 
in evolutionary biology and genetics, in particular from 1990 with the launch of the Human Genome Project, 
while in more traditional visual art, strong influences of biology were also noticeable, for example 
in the works of Chadwick s viral landscapes, Hirst s animal dissections, and Borland s preoccupation 
with anatomy (Figure 5). Though by the mid-1990s Sims and Latham had become involved in new commercially 
focussed projects outside computer art, the core themes and ideas were taken up by new groups of artists 
including Jon McCormack and Steven Rooke, and then extended further with the full emergence of the artificial 
life research field and associated conferences [26]. Becoming interested again in research, Latham moved 
back into academia in 2005 and became professor of computer art at Goldsmiths, University of London in 
2007, where he collaborated with professor Frederic Fol Leymarie and worked again with Stephen Todd after 
a gap of 12 years. His recent work has included re-applying the old FormGrow and Mutator systems rewritten 
in Java and OpenGL to the world of genomics and scientific visualization in collaboration with the structural 
bioinformatics team at Imperial College London [27, 28]. References 1. Mandelbrot, Benoit, Fractal Aspects

 Early History of French CG Cécile Welker ABSTRACT This paper provides an historical summary of the emergence 
of computer graphics research and creation in France between 1970 and 1990, a period of innovation that 
transformed artistic practice and French visual media. The paper shows the role of these developments 
in the history of art, the evolution of digital technology, and the expansion of animation and visual 
effects in the film industry. Early History of French Computer Graphics The first books devoted to the 
discipline of computer science were published in the late 1970s, in Britain and the United States [1]. 
In France, the first symposium on this topic took place in 1988 [2], and Pierre Eric Mounier Kuhn in 
particular has been a leading voice for the discipline since the 1990s. At the same time, the subdiscipline 
of computer graphics (CG) has had very little presence in this history of computers and computer science, 
although some initiatives exist, since CG affects the history of technology, the history of images, and 
the history of special effects [3]. If the state of the industry is sometimes studied in the United States, 
this is not the case in France, where researchers and authors have so far only focused on the history 
of major groups [4] and networks [5]. This paper presents a history of computer graphics in France, as 
a heritage that is worth keeping alive, since France was very active in CG in the early 1980s. Based 
on the dynamics of French creativity, the government s plan, known as Recherche-image [6], has promoted 
many initiatives. Post-production companies, research laboratories, and training programs were created 
and geared towards specialized CG [7]. SIGGRAPH Computer Animation Festival selections are evidence of 
this. Since 1987, 6 13 percent of selected films were French [8], but still we know little of this history. 
If some landmark events in the history of computer graphics occurred in France [9], no books, no theses 
relate a French history of CG. When we look at the reference books [10], only a few lines are devoted 
to French practitioners and outputs. For this reason, a research program devoted to the history of CG 
in France is now gaining popularity [11]. Our research constitutes a historical archive from the perspective 
of preservation. Indeed, if this topic deserves to be discussed, and should eventually lead to a comparative 
study between France and other countries, such as the United States or Japan, an overview of French CG 
history needs to be written first. By relying on historical documents and testimonies of computer graphics 
pioneers, this paper presents a historical overview as well as descriptions of some significant initiatives 
that took place in France between 1970 and 1990. It aims to highlight why and how this environment of 
computer graphics was constituted and to summarize its origins. Scientific Research Even before the creation 
of genuine academic research teams, isolated individuals conducted critical work in the field of computer 
graphics. In the early 1960s, Pierre Bézier [12], at Renault, invented the curves that bear his name 
and are still used in the objects that surround us, in the texts we read, for instance. At the same time, 
Gilbert Comparetti [13] presented the basics of what animation software should be, developed the idea 
into a tool, and tracked its development of computer-animated productions [14]. Since he is considered 
the father of the French computer-animated cartoon [15], in 1965, a research team was formed in Grenoble 
that gave rise to the first thesis in the field of computer graphics [16]. In 1971, Henri Gouraud, after 
graduating from the École Centrale and Sup Aero (in Paris), obtained a PhD from the University of Utah. 
He collaborated with all the men who were to develop computer graphics in the 1970s, such as John Warnock, 
Ivan Sutherland, Tom Stockham and Dave Evans. The result of his research the Gouraud shading is still 
programmed in the heart of today s graphics cards (Figure 1). In 1972, Ed Catmull, future cofounder of 
Pixar, and Fred Parke created the first 3D film [17] using Gouraud rendering, whose results were published 
in the United States [18]. In France in the early 1970s, a team was formed in INRIA [19] as well as a 
graphic working group within the AFCET [20]. They organized many meetings and workshops, including the 
Seillac seminar [21] in 1976, which brought together researchers from around the world in order to standardize 
graphics software. Research teams multiplied: École des Mines de Saint Étienne [22], ENST Paris [23], 
ACROE Grenoble [24], as well as other teams in Lille, Toulouse, and Nantes. In 1980, the Eurographics 
Association was created, while Institut national de l audiovisuel [25] was established along with Arc 
Senans in 1981, a seminar on processing and image synthesis applied to audio/visual creation. Many initiatives 
demonstrated the emergence of a circle of researchers working on developing computer graphics in France. 
This is confirmed by the report Michel Lucas produced in 1995, which describes the evolution of research 
on computer graphics from 1965 to 1995 [26]. In parallel, artists showed an increasing interest in computers, 
ranging from computer-assisted painting to the use of computers as medium. Artistic Experimentation The 
first generation of computerized still images was created by Frieder Nake, Georg Nees, and Michael Noll, 
who worked on the principle of chance theorized by Abraham Moles in 1971 [27]. Manfred Mohr, for his 
part, systematized the idea of series, and presented the very first museum exhibition [28] in France 
of works calculated using a computer. The journal Computer and Automation had already organized a contest 
of drawings by computer in 1963. This episode was decisive, for the selection criteria were not merely 
mathematical or technical, but also artistic. The exhibition Cybernetic Serendipity in London in 1968 
would be one of the first consequences of this change in status. It is therefore often cited as a precursor 
to what is now called digital art [29]. Although art production in these years was mostly inspired by 
geometric abstraction, the artist Charles Csuri and the engineer James Shaffer won the Computer and Automation 
contest in 1967 for their work Sine Curve Man. This was a move toward figurative representation, as they 
created computer programs that were more flexible and produced portraits using deformation. Computer 
memory and printouts were limited, so these preliminary works were expressed in black and white. Some 
products, however, are recognizable by their colors. Hervé Huitric and Monique Nahas developed an interest 
in color and its algorithmization, making silkscreen frames printed from a computer [30]. Pierre-Louis 
Neumann attempted to reproduce his own conceptual approach through programming so as to find the most 
accurate composition, which he then realized in painting. Peter Foldes [31] came up with the idea of 
animating these two-dimensional drawings by computer. His first tests, carried out with the support of 
the National Film Board of Canada and entitled Metadata and Hunger [32] (Figure 2), depicted an animation 
interpolation process using digital technology that creates a flat perspective effect through chained 
metamorphoses [33]. Graphics tablets appeared in the early 1980s and allowed experimentation by designers 
as well as artists in 2D-animated productions. In 1985, Michaël Gaumnitz began to work on Graph 8, a 
paint system made by a French company, X-Com, with which he has directed several short films for television, 
Femmes and Le courier des téléspectateurs series [34], in particular (Figure 3). These videos captured 
the moving image, the image being drawn [35]. Many French researchers had already experimented with 3D-animated 
images in the 1970s. Gilbert Comparetti [36] (Figure 4) and Manfred Mohr [37] provided outstanding examples 
of 3D animation work using Wireframe. After the military, medical imaging, and industrial applications, 
another area began to incorporate the interest of CG imagery, the audio/visual. A market for computer 
graphics appeared in France in the 1980s, with the initiative of the company Sogitec in particular, which 
declaimed the hopes for a new world created by the computer [38]. From Flight Simulators to the Audio/Visual 
Industry In 1981, in response to a commission from the aircraft manufacturer Dassault, Sogitec established 
a computer graphics department, under the direction of Claude Mechoulam, in order to develop a flight 
simulator system and real-time image generation [39]. Like the U.S. company Evans &#38; Sutherland, Sogitec 
was a striking example of the impact of the military in the history of computer graphics. Very quickly, 
the company turned to new productions, when Xavier Nicolas, head of broadcasting, utilized the potential 
of these systems to model and animate images for TV and film [40]. The first applications included rendering 
and skinning in television commercials, thereby supporting the development and learning of the relevant 
techniques. Advertisers such as Canon [41], GDF [42], and BNP [43] promoted their brands by launching 
themselves into modernity. Sharp communicated a journey to perfection in 1983 [44], incorporating new 
images [45] in an ad for copying machines and calculators (Figure 5). The same year, André Martin and 
Philippe Quéau presented Maison vole [46], the French-scripted short film, whose images and sounds are 
totally synthetic (Figure 6), co-produced by Sogitec and the research and development department of the 
Institut national de l audiovisuel. The cinema started using digital effects later. In 1986, Christian 
Guillon directed the special effects in CG of the first French full-length animated feature [47], L unique 
[48] (Figure 7). Then everything accelerated when the main creators of actual 3D opened their own studios. 
In 1985, the architect Pierre Buffin, with Henri Seydoux, created BSCA, which later became Buf compagnie 
[49]. Simultaneously, five students were meeting over weekends and realized La vie des bêtes [50] (Figure 
8), which resulted in the creation of the studio Mac Guff Ligne [51]. After a few achievements in the 
Ina and Sogitec, Georges Lacroix, Renato and Jean-Yves Grall created Fantôme [52], known for the series 
Fables géométriques [53] (Figure 9). The possibilities offered by the virtual camera and synthetic objects 
suddenly freed writers and directors from physical restraints due to gravity, reminding us that these 
early images were created by adapting the techniques of flight simulators. They would make excessive 
use of this new freedom, especially as textures and animations were still very poor. Early computer graphics 
illustrate both modernity, often using a universe of science fiction, and the technical constraints of 
the time [54]. Digital techniques contributed to the invention of new visual and fictional worlds. The 
French pioneers also experimented with purely artistic perspectives. Towards Digital Art and Virtual 
Reality In 1975, IBM France dedicated an issue of its magazine to art and computers [55]. Alongside international 
works, there were many French achievements, such as research and artistic work by Pierre-Louis Dahan 
and Phac Le Tuan [56], the Groupe de Belfort, and CAD with images by Jean-Marc Brun and Michel Théron 
[57]. In 1976, Vera and François Molnar created one of the first programs for image generation, Molnart. 
Hervé Huitric and Monique Nahas made their first movie on a computer in 1979 [58] as part of the activity 
of the computer group of Vincennes, which was created a few years earlier. The Art and Technology of 
Image Department (ATI) of Université Paris 8 was created in 1982, and the department AII, Workshop Image 
and Computing, was also created at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs de Paris in the 
same year [59]. The ATI team, consisting of Hervé Huitric, from fine arts; Monique Nahas, professor of 
theoretical physics; Michel Bret, painter and professor of mathematics; and Edmond Couchot, designer 
of interactive installations, set up a hybrid research program and teaching syllabus, at the crossroads 
between art and programming [60]. The notion of interactivity with the viewer was not born with the computer: 
Op art is just one example among many [61]. In this line, the apparatuses built by Edmond Couchot, Yaacov 
Agam, and Myron Krueger in the 70s [62] react to the viewer s movements by shifts in light and sound 
to incorporate notions of temporality. Piotr Kowalski allowed the viewer to act remotely on a synthetic 
image [63], or to intervene in real time on the video [64], and in 1982, Tom DeWitt developed an interactive 
screen [65, 66]. The first trials of computer graphics at ATI plunged the spectator deeper into interactive 
installations and virtual universes, implementing the principles of virtual reality, gradually distinguishing 
different degrees of interactivity. La petite danseuse [67], a model synthesis, began to execute typically 
digital movements (Figure 10). La plume [68] was the beginning of what would later become Je sème à tout 
vent [69], where viewers blowing on feathers or synthetic flowers on the screen realize that they have 
an impact on their movement (Figure 11). These works laid out the principles of virtual reality, as defined 
by Fuchs in 1996 [70]. The various features of what is called virtual reality changing time and place 
through interactions and the purpose of this reality are implemented in order to enable one or more people 
to experience some sensory-motor and cognitive activities in an artificial, digitally created world which 
may be imaginary, symbolic, or may simulate some aspects of the real world [71]. Works like The legible 
city [72] and Pissenlit [73] are historical examples of this virtual reality. In the first example, viewers 
are involved without substitution in the action, sitting on a bike that allows them to feel closer to 
the reality of this virtual city, even though it is made up of words. In the second case, viewers breath 
symbolizes the wind that puts the flower in motion on the screen. Since these pioneering works, several 
interfaces have associated immersion (sensing) and interaction (acting upon). They gave rise to varying 
degrees of motor skills, while interactive possibilities for telecommunications, then rapidly expanding, 
brought the notion of dispositif to the forefront. Broad public acceptance of the computer as medium 
was nurtured by the dominance of computer graphics in film and television production, and the technology's 
role in creating digital art. Towards Expansion Nowadays, the greatest part of the turnover of a number 
of French companies is obtained abroad, while many computer animators choose to work abroad [74]. Where 
do these talents and skills derive from? The French touch has been exported since the 1990s, first as 
expertise in software [75]. Indeed, many ingenious pioneers strove to develop their own tools. In 1985, 
Pascal Terracol and Olivier Emery produced one of the first commercially available 3D animation software 
packages for the PC, Imagix-3D [76]. When it was lent to MacGuff, this software helped to initiate the 
company s activities [77]. The most striking example is the software Explore. In 1986, Jean-Charles Hourcade, 
along with Daniel Borestein and Alain Nicolas, merged the 3D studio Ina and Thomson CSF into the new 
company TDI [78], thereby laying the foundations of Explore, which became the best-selling 3D software 
in 1991 [79]. It was sold in 1993 to Wavefront, and its bases can still be found today in Maya. Then, 
creativity took over. Sogitec produced 80 commercials for the English market from 1984 onwards. When 
the company merged with TDI to become ExMachina, it soon appear[ed] that the film market [was] not sufficient 
for the development of the company [80]. It therefore branched out to produce films for theme parks and 
special events, especially in the US and Asia. ExMachina opened an office in Tokyo as early as 1992, 
partly in order to commercialize rides [81]. Sub Oceanic shuttle [82] was the first CG product of Iwerks 
Entertainment and was followed by many others. After the success of La cité des enfants perdus [83], 
the special effects supervisor of Batman and Robin used Buf compagnie to work on 56 shots of the film 
[84]. Buf later developed the visual effects in film after film in the U.S. [85]. Although directors 
have testified that exchanges between the French and Americans existed at the time as the festival Imagina 
in Monte-Carlo, which encouraged the use of graphics work in Europe, illustrates productions during these 
years were very different. Maison vole [86] was produced in late 1982, the very year Tron [87] was released. 
Three years later, Pixar produced Luxo Jr. [88]. Was it simply that means and techniques were quite different? 
Or is it that these nouvelles images were regarded differently in the two countries? There were many 
French productions in those pioneering days, and today French expertise is still recognized. Should we 
go so far as to suggest that there is such a thing as a French school of computer graphics? Or did 3D 
productions develop uniformly on all continents? This research now deserves to be taken further: a thorough 
analysis of the productions, as well as a comparative historical approach of the three countries that 
evince outstanding creativity and imagination the United States, Canada, and Japan should be the next 
steps. References and Notes 1. Goldstine, Herman H., The Computer from Pascal to Von Neumann (Princeton:

 Cloud Pink Yunsil Heo, Hyunwoo Bang Cloud Pink is an immersive media installation with a giant stretchable 
fabric that covers the entire gallery ceiling. Viewers can poke this sky with their fingers, stirring 
the simulated pink cloud that floats on it. Lying down on a hill, with your eyes filled with the endless 
blue sky, your perspective is suddenly distorted, and clouds drift at the tip of your nose. You stretch 
your arms up to the sky to touch the clouds but you can t reach them. It s another world just above your 
head: clouds. Touch the pink clouds drifting on a giant fabric screen and remember your childhood clouds 
of dreams. I spent countless sleepless nights just to realize my unproductive and romantic cloud of words. 
But isn t it beautiful to feel the clouds at your fingertips? Yunsil Heo Hyunwoo Bang Seoul National

 Digiti Sonus Yoon Chung Han, Byeong-jun Han Fingerprints are unique biometric patterns on human and 
primate bodies. They are clearly recognizable patterns that can be manipulated and saved into large databases. 
Due to their distinct and unique visual patterns, they have been useful for personal identification and 
security. In this digital era, many computing machines and digital interfaces use fingerprints as secure 
keys to identify and access personal information. We believe fingerprints are the most intuitive and 
powerful source of data that represent an individual s pure voice and identity. There is no trick or 
filter on the fingerprint patterns. Only the simple, spiral pattern displays the truth of human birth, 
genes, and growth. Thus, finger­prints are a powerful resource not only for revealing societal identities, 
but also for exploring our bodies inner, unconscious, and pure voices. Digiti Sonus is an interactive 
audio/visual art installation based on fingerprint sonification. Transforming fingerprints unique patterns 
into sonic results allows the audience to experience the discovery of sensory identities. The sonification 
of data produces a real-time music composi­tion as a representation of integrated human identities. The 
distinct visual features of fingerprints as an open musical score are executed in diverse ways and converted 
into three-dimensional animated images. By varying the starting point of animated visuals, the musical 
notes are reorganized in different orders and duration, and they resonate in listeners bodies and minds. 
In this artwork, sonification can serve as an effective technique for representing complex information 
like human body patterns, due to the auditory system s ability to perceive a broad range of stimuli. 
Transforming fingerprints unique patterns into sonic results allows listeners to discover sensory identities. 
The data is transformed into different XYZN scales and magnified into an immersive audio/ visual representation. 
Listeners can perform musical sounds, provid­ing input that results in dynamic audio/visual output. This 
work is the result of DaVinci Media art project 2012, which is supported by Seoul Art Space and Geumcheon 
art space. Yoon Chung Han University of California, Santa Barbara yoon@mat.ucsb.edu Byeong-jun Han Korea

 Drawing Machine Robert Twomey Drawing Machine is the latest in a series of conceptual subtractions from 
the parameters of drawing as an art act. A precision-controlled CNC device labors in place of the artist, 
working with unfaltering patience and inhuman precision to fill a sketchbook with images over the course 
of the exhibition. This project marries my technical interests in motor control, image vectorization, 
and machinic spectacle with my history as a painter. Drawing has been my most heartfelt and originally 
self-defining activity as an artist, but I find it difficult to place the value of drawing in the context 
of other readily available image-reproduction technologies. A doppelgänger or substitute, this project 
reintroduces drawing as the output of a laboring machine, raising questions of absence and presence, 
expression, and the value of the handmade. The uneasy combination of technical fascination and artistic 
desire is a recurrent theme through­out my work. In other projects I have reflected on computer vision, 
natural language processing, and speech recognition, colliding these techniques with personal content 
to illuminate essential questions of identity, embodiment, and cognition in our time. Drawing Machine 
examines multiple notions of scale. As a mechatronic system, the twin-pulley hanging plotter system is 
designed to be inherently scalable. The drive belt and modular pulley system can expand the working space 
of the machine from 14 inches x 17 inches (the size of the sketchbook) to a 12 foot x 20 foot wall, and 
it can operate with the same sub-millimeter precision across those scales. Beyond these physical qualities, 
Drawing Machine examines the dynamics of plasticity and material resistance in digital fabrication processes: 
how the relative ease of trans­formations in software manifests as time-to-manufacture, duration, and 
cost when realized in the material world. In the larger context of my art practice, I wish to achieve 
some reconciliation of my ambition to vanguard technical explorations with the tradition and history 
of a studio-based practice. This piece is one incremental excursion in that larger project. Robert Twomey

 Expressive Maps Santiago V. Lombeyda Expressive Maps is an artistic visualization of a complete mouse 
DNA sequence, taken from embryonic mouse muscle tissue, stretched out in a line. Each individual spiral 
represents a single chromosome (mice have 20, versus 23 in humans), and active sections perform calls 
across the corresponding chromosome addresses. It displays three stages of development: before specialization, 
60 hours after specialization, and 60 hours post-specialization with an inhibitor present. Each stage 
has been printed on vellum, so one map can be placed on top of another to reveal differences. The pioneering 
science of genetics and molecular biology works on trying to understand amazingly complex systems that 
regulate life systems encapsulated at a microscopic scale. Despite their size, these systems carry all 
the information necessary to describe, architect, regulate, and enable our existence. At the core are 
macromolecules (DNA) too small to observe in action. And yet if we were to stretch it out, one single 
DNA chain would measure between three and nine feet in length. Using experiments, we can measure the 
rate of calls across the DNA, triggering or inhibiting specific segments or genes. Studying these interactions 
before and after specialization (the process of self-determining the type of specific muscle cell it 
will become) provides a key to understanding cell dynamics. Graphics visualization tools are valuable 
tools in this challenging area of active research. These expressive maps are not only scientifically 
accurate and meaningful, but they are snapshots of a dynamic system, minute and yet quite grandiose, 
and ultimately awe-inspiring. Santiago V. Lombeyda California Institute of Technology slombey@caltech.edu

 Four Mountains Mark J. Stock Four Mountains consists of tiny, rapid-prototyped models of four tall stratovolcanoes 
in the US Pacific Northwest, each isolated, framed, and arranged on the gallery wall to scale, viewed 
from above, from the point of view of a god (or an astronaut). It draws attention to not only the mountains 
detailed, crisp forms, but also to the empty spaces in between. Contrast the attention given to the peaks 
with the empty spaces between them. The featureless gallery walls are a placeholder for ordinary landscape. 
This plane has no characteristic scale save that imposed by the mountains. The frames make a prison-like 
separation between the zones that reinforces their unequal standing. Sculpture is being reinvented by 
rapid-prototyping (3D printers) and alternative manufacturing techniques. The accurate mountain models 
in this work would not have been possible without several key pieces of computational geometry and image-processing 
technology, including LiDAR-acquired data from the US Geological Survey, 3D printing systems, and a number 
of pieces of custom and open-source software. This project is a departure from my usual work, but does 
not stray far from my roots of using computational authorship to investigate natural phenomena from vantage 
points freed from the constraints of our beings. Much of my work leverages computational-physics software 
to generate alternate spatiotemporal realities, generally featuring fluid dynamics. But unlike physical 
fluid flows, the structure of which is normally observed indirectly, mountains are so massive and seemingly 
timeless that their visual forms are etched indelibly into our minds, and to see them any other way requires 
us to do something extraordinary. The act of miniaturization short-circuits this relationship. What was 
far away and dramatically steep is now just a corrugated sheet of laser-sintered nylon. What was once 
unattainable now fits in a pocket. By transforming the subject from its physical reality into the digital 
realm, we are able to manipulate it, free of the limitations of mass and energy, and thus break our traditional 
relationship with it. Mark J. Stock mstock@umich.edu  Rendering of work on display, &#38;#169; 2013

 Long View Patrick Fitzgerald, Daniel Lunk, Lee Cherry, Jim Martin, Dwayne Martin Long View is a gesture-based 
interactive installation that offers the viewer the ability to affect animated elements in a projected 
space in ways that the artists hope will increase awareness of our fragile and temporary relationship 
to our planet. Our piece integrates open-source, physics-based gaming engines in Flash with our own gesture-based 
interactive system that uses the Microsoft Kinect as an input device. The installation allows and encourages 
viewers to interact with the projected elements by moving their hands and bodies in a natural way. The 
projected planet view exhibits visual and behavioral changes over time and evolves as human technology 
and industrialization advances. Viewers can play with these ecosytems to change them in various ways. 
The piece itself loops and metaphorically creates a conundrum about humanity s long-term relationship 
to the earth. It relates to the SIGGRAPH 2013 Art Gallery theme XYZN: Scale in that it covers vast epochs 
of time and creates different experiences depending on viewers proximity to the projection. We are interested 
in creating interactive systems and experiences that are intuitive and require no learned grammar. We 
believe that in the future, gesture-based interactive spaces and experiences will become a common way

 Rhumb Lines Barbara Mary Keating Rhumb Lines is a playful, immersive, cinematic, interactive video installation 
that explores how we think we know where we are in time, space, and history. It invites viewers to navigate 
a mesmerizing series of interlinked videos using location data and scanning the horizon to seek out hidden 
co-ordinates and signs of the River Tyne s magnetic attraction for artists over the centuries, translated 
into beautiful Red One super-wide-screen images. Viewers scroll a map generated from sonar-scan data, 
with the GPS tracks overlaid to trigger corresponding videos. They scrub through the cinematic widescreen 
videos seeking journey intersections, and the frames of video are graded to look like archive paintings. 
Device control creates an apparent suspension of real time that could be staged on any waterway in the 
world with sonar-scan survey data. I was brought up by the sea, and the UK is an island nation with a 
significant maritime history. The River Tyne was the first place to have a Life Brigade, and subsequently 
painted narratives of the sea turned from wreckage and war to the saving of lives. I began to imagine 
a point where all possible journeys in time and space intersect in the river s mouth. Using daymarks, 
lighthouses, and modern instruments, I set out to explore it. I m fascinated by navigational history, 
theory, and technology ancient and modern, and the logical outcome of following a rhumb line. After taking 
an initial bearing, one proceeds along that bearing, without changing direction as measured relative 
to true north. An infinite spiral is traversed, because the earth is round. With the above in mind, I 
looked at local archive paintings of the river and began colour-grading video to resemble some of the 
paintings. I then experimented with reverse zoom, filming from vessels, panning and tilting to keep the 
piers at the river mouth in centre frame, but it is not possible to achieve this effect manually or in 
post-production. We adapted software to make GPS control the camera zoom, matching the speed of the vessel 
precisely using Red One digital technology. GPS tracks were recorded during filming, day and night.

 Shared Skies (13 global skies) Kim Abeles Shared Skies is a series of digital prints and sculpture using 
photographs of skies collected from four sources: my own journeys, artists who participate as they travel 
worldwide, international friends through social media, and some purchased from photographers through 
stock photo sites. The work speaks to the connections among global, local, and personal. As people look 
toward the sky each morning, through the day and night, the sky speaks to their personal and local concerns. 
In a global sense, we observe the effects of our environmental decisions and find community through a 
seamless sky. Shared Skies began as a permanent, large-scale artwork that I am creating for the new Anderson-Munger 
YMCA in Los Angeles. As part of the process to consider the implications of the idea, I started by making 
digital prints with groupings of 13 skies each. These are being produced by Sundog Multiples, a print 
atelier at the University of North Dakota. Each sky is identified with the location and the name of the 
photographer. For this ongoing series, there are currently hundreds of sky photographs from 38 countries 
and all the continents. The project would not be possible without the networking that the internet provides. 
These skies can be requested and sent by anyone with a camera and access to a computer (public or private). 
The sky as a metaphor can be felt and understood by all. Kim Abeles Abeles Studio kimabeles@earthlink.net

 Spatial Hyperlink Wan-Ying Lai, Ming-Chang Wu, Shen-Guan Shih Spatial Hyperlink, a telecommunications 
art installation, explores an ideal social interaction. The work encourages viewers awareness of others 
psychological states via speaking boxes through which images and sounds can be transmitted over unknown 
distances. Devices installed in different places become a giant communication network. Users are able 
to influence remote doors by opening their own. With each opening, the people and the scenes behind the 
doors become visible to people in other locations around the world. Each door opening creates a unique 
experience, a personal assemblage made up of sounds and images created by interactions with the piece. 
In addition, the sounds of knocking and the user voices are anchored in space and attract passersby to 
come near and respond. Communications across remote distances are precipitated and accelerated when people 
happen upon the installation in action, creating a Spatial Hyperlink. The linking process itself consists 
not only of accumulating sounds and images, but also the users exploratory behavior. Users can talk, 
smile, transmit a kiss, or just ignore the opportunity. In this way, a new kind of social interactive 
mode emerges the moment a knock on the door is answered. Wan-Ying Lai Ming-Chang Wu Shen-Guan Shih National

 Swarm Vision George Legrady, Marco Pinter, Danny Bazo Swarm Vision is an installation consisting of 
multiple pan-tilt-zoom cameras on rails positioned above spectators in an exhibition space. Each camera 
behaves autonomously based on programmed rules of computer vision. In the installation, four visualizations 
are featured on two screens or projections. The first screen features what each of the three cameras 
sees. The second screen shows a 3D reconstruction of the environment featuring a live video stream of 
the location of the cameras and the images they generate. Each camera continuously produces 10 still 
frames per second and fills the 3D space with up to 100 images per camera, their size and location determined 
by the focal plane and focus location. Early images fade away, creating a continuously changing sculptural 
structure. In the exhibition setting, visual segments of spectators who enter the viewing space populate 
the images, leaving an imprint of their presence that is later erased as the images sequentially fade 
away. With the two screens, viewers can perceive both individual cameras behaviors (microcosmic) and 
their relationships to each other (macrocosmic). The project explores the transformative condition of 
the photographic process as it transitions from the still, transparent image to one that is reified within 
physical space. The installation synthesizes knowledge and experience from the three collaborators to 
translate human perception and cultural usage of the photographic image to machine vision. Contributions 
from George Legrady address the function and our perception of photography. Danny Bazo s background in 
robotics, visual arts, and image processing helps realize many technical aspects of the project. Marco 
Pinter s extensive background in engineering, medical robotics, and research provides a logistic framework.

 This Exquisite Forest Aaron Koblin Conceived by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin and produced by Tate Modern 
and Google, This Exquisite Forest was inspired by the surrealist game "exquisite corpse" and its idea 
of collaborative creation. The project lets users create short animations that build off one another 
as they explore specific themes. The result is a collection of branching narratives resembling trees 
to which anyone may contribute. The project lives online and as a physical installation at the Tate Modern 
(through June 2013). At the museum, visitors can explore the project as a life-sized projection and contribute 
animations using high-end digital drawing tablets. Our work is about exploring the line between a pre-determined 
experience and an open one. We re interested in thinking about how much freedom the viewer should have 
within the artwork. For example, in This Exquisite Forest, we give artists an open canvas to create any 
animation they like, but also the power to moderate and set rules for how that animation may evolve. 
Likewise, with The Johnny Cash Project, participants are given a single frame as a template, but then 
they are free to interpret that frame in any way they choose. We have tried a similar approach with interactive 
film. In The Wilderness Downtown, we let viewers change the experience by focusing it around their childhood 
homes using Google Maps and Street View. And with our fourth project, Three Dreams of Black, viewers 
can control the camera and create 3D sculptures that persist in the film for everyone to see. New advances 
in web-browser technology have been at the core of each project. The web is intrinsically a great example 
of the SIGGRAPH 2013 Art Gallery theme. This Exquisite Forest is built around scale; it requires the 
participation of thousands of people to fulfill its goal of creating an evolving forest of animations.

 Traces: Plankton on the Move Cynthia Beth Rubin, Susanne Menden-Deuer, Elizabeth Harvey, Jerry Fishenden 
Traces is a collaboration between the artist Cynthia Beth Rubin and the Menden-Deuer Lab at the Graduate 
School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, which studies plankton, the microscopic marine creatures 
that comprise the most basic piece of our food chain. The original micro-captures are of specimens in 
small batches of water, devoid of any association with their native environment, and filmed in flat grays. 
In Rubin s transformation of the raw video, she imagines the plankton moving in water that is infinitely 
deep, making these mystical creatures leap beyond the confines of the microscopic world into an enticing 
world of color and movement that begs us to relate to them as part of nature. She does not just reveal 
the generally unseen life in our ocean waters; she makes it accessible. The series grew from a practical 
concern. Researcher Elizabeth Harvey captured the image of a magical moment: an encounter between a predator, 
Favella, and its prey, Heterosigma akashiwo. The color balance of that image needed an artist s touch 
to come alive. From this scientifically accurate work, Rubin moved to bringing the same sense of imagination 
and wonder to the world of microscopic plankton that she has long explored in the world of imagined human 
memories. What does it take to make the depiction of a space feel real, inhabitable, and even familiar? 
How can we step out of our own world into the activity of the ocean? Technology makes this possible. 
From the digital capture of microscopic plankton to the ability to put these images into analytical and 
modifying video software, technology makes the intertwining of visual sources an avenue for exploration. 
At the outset, the artist spent weeks understanding the forms of the plankton, learning to relate to 
them, and generating variations of the video. The final colored version was selected in discussion with 
the scientists, balancing scientific and artistic focus. The sound score by Jerry Fishenden was composed 
specially to add classic drama to the video. Cynthia Beth Rubin C B Rubin Studio rubin@siggraph.org

 Visualizing Federal Spending Rebecca Ruige Xu, Sean Hongsheng Zhai In this project we explore an aesthetics-oriented 
approach to visualizing federal spending in the United States as 3D compositions in a photorealistic 
style. Using procedural modeling with Python programming and Maya API, an organic flow of intermingled 
geometrical units is formed to represent the profile of federal spending for each state, loosely resembling 
the idea of money flow. The total amount of spending is scaled to a per capita basis to make different 
states comparable, while the overall surface area or volume occupied by each type of geometrical pattern 
represents its associated spending data. With data provided by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse 
at Syracuse University, we analyzed federal spending by agencies and then mapped this data to distinguishable 
geometric patterns. Often, the shapes hint at what they represent: for example, leaf shapes for agriculture, 
spikes for military-related spending, cubes for housing, and torus (life buoys) for education. Unsurprisingly, 
top spending categories like social security and health and human services, seen as floating ribbon shapes, 
are dominant attributes for most states. To create an aesthetically sophisticated but not overwhelming 
presentation of the dataset, we further fine-tuned the per capita scales while maintaining the interrelation 
among different types of spending. Photorealistic rendering produces shadings with vivid nuances, endowing 
the geometries with a tangible quality and enhancing the sense of volume. The complicity of the output 
reflects the intricate nature of the subject and allows more exploratory freedom for viewers to observe 
and then make their own sense of the embedded information. We also hope this project will stimulate further 
research on the topic of federal spending. Rebecca Ruige Xu Missouri State Univerisity rebeccaxu@missouristate.edu

 Water Columns Mark Weston Water Columns consists of three extremely lightweight, passively actuated 
kinetic sculptures that take advantage of the relative tendency of wood to absorb moisture from the atmosphere 
to create passive engines for actuation of a long array of bi-laminate filaments. The sculptures change 
shape over the course of the day as relative humidity rises and falls with the ambient temperature. This 
project iterates error. It is evident in natural systems that specific situations demand specific solutions. 
These solutions do not emerge in perfection, but instead derive from eons of accidents. Similarly, the 
iterative nature of digital design allows us to rapidly create and discard innumerable virtual notions 
in an almost time-lapse analog of biological evolution. We can instantly amass manifold errors, find 
the singular best mistake, and repeat it forever unto perfection. In the massive potential scale of these 
deliberate derailments hides an equally massive potential for making nonsense, and therein lies the knuckleball. 
Perfecting the forced error with computers requires an art that can balance knowledge and technique against 
measured carelessness, with a willingness to repeatedly miss central goals until fresh opportunities 
re-form at the fringes. As the contemporary practice of architecture continually seeks such fresh economies 
in computer modeling and digital fabrication, it becomes possible to produce a modern architecture that 
leverages these techniques to reintroduce handmade material quality to the stark modernist conception 
of space-making. This new material saturation cannot, however, be allowed to stagnate into decadence; 
the ecological problems stemming from our messy habitation of earth force us to acknowledge that too 
much is at stake. This suggests, therefore, a process that foresees the creation of buildings that possess 
a saturated material character by virtue of the use of performative, intelligent materials that blur 
the boundary between beauty and pragmatism. From these ideals emerges a multi-disciplinary practice, 
combining experimental materials, digital fabrication, and physical computing with traditional notions 
of making in order to generate interactive and complex physical environments. The goal of Water Columns 
is to re-situate architecture between art, construction, environment, and activism, where work is conceived 
in a constant, non-linear interplay between hand-making, computer modeling, computer simulation, and 
CNC tooling. Mark Weston University of South Florida mw@usf.edu  Water Columns, &#38;#169; 2012 Mark
