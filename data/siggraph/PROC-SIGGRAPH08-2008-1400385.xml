		<par><![CDATA[<p>We are witnessing a shift in how designers conceptualize, detail, and fabricate their work. Architects increasingly talk about scripting or writing an architectural fa&#231;ade rather than drawing it. Buildings and everyday objects are conceptualized and fabricated via lines of code in addition to being drawn by hand or with CAD software. Tools for manipulating digital information have provided designers new means for expression as well as new "materials" with radically different properties.</p> <p>Digital methods and tools used by architects and designers have co-evolved with computer graphics and interactive technologies in leaps and bounds. The SIGGRAPH 2008 Design & Computation exhibit weaves together analog and digital, past and present, theory and artifact to give visitors a taste of an exploding field. The work has been selected to invite multiple layers of engagement and address the SIGGRAPH community's wide range of interests.</p> <p>Contemporary developments, however, are not without precedent. Long before advanced computer graphics, designers reshaped their tools. For example, the work of Joseph Marie Jacquard was not only significant for the textile industry, but also laid the foundation for contemporary computational design processes. On the one hand, his invention revolutionized the way in which silk-weavers from his hometown, Lyon, wove elaborate and varied figures. On the other hand, Jacquard's work embodied the ability to control a sequence of operations and fabricate an end result in a single process.</p> <p>Two Design & Computation discussion panels complement the exhibit, raising questions on complexity and craftsmanship. In the Complexity panel, architects and designers ask how tools and methods used by architects, artists, and designers contribute to the complexity of built forms. What are the problems and opportunities that increased complexity engenders both for built forms and for people's experience of these forms? The Craftsmanship panel examines the relationship among creator, tool, and final creation. Artists and designers reflect on how they conceive their work, discussing whether mediation through a digital fabrication processes alters their relationship with materials and their creations.</p>]]></par>

 SIGGRAPH 2008 ART &#38; DeSIGn GAlleRIeS | DESIGN &#38; COMPUTATION INTRODUCTION imagine the algorithm 
William J. Mitchell Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology Robot Craft Among the things we admire about craftspeople are their fundamental skill sets: 
their abilities to execute certain operations beautifully, swiftly, and reliably. When I was a beginning 
architecture student, for example (before the days of CAD), I learned to execute a perfectly graduated 
wash with lamp black watercolor on Whatman s hot-press paper to make an evenly ruled India ink line on 
vellum with crisp ends and no smearing, and (with an HB clutch pencil) to letter like an architect. This 
required close knowledge of the relevant tools and materials, hand-eye coordination, and lots of practice. 
Acquiring these and other skills was a large part of mastering my craft. The digitally controlled machines 
used to produce the objects on display in the Design &#38; Computation gallery are robot craftspeople 
with very narrow skill sets. Each one does a few things really well and tirelessly. Laser cutters cut 
out shapes from sheet material. Routers and milling machines precisely position milling heads to remove 
material from solid blocks. Deposition printers place tiny pellets of polymer exactly where you specify. 
Furthermore, these machines are not set up to perform operations repetitively. They are programmable. 
They accept sequences of instructions to perform operations in their skill sets. These instructions are 
parameterized. To tell a laser cutter to cut along a straight line, for example, you provide the end­point 
coordinates of that particular line. Programmability means that the familiar logic of mass pro­duction 
 of achieving economies of scale through repetition no longer applies. It is no more costly to cut lines 
that arbitrarily vary from one to the next than it is to cut lines that are all alike. It is possible 
to program instruction sequences directly, and in the early days of numerically controlled fabrication 
(beginning in the 1940s) this was exactly how it was done. Code specifying the types of operations to 
be performed, together with the coor­dinates, was fed into machines on paper tape or punch cards. Computer-Aided 
Design But designers generally don t think in these terms. Instead of working directly with process descriptions 
that specify how to make something, they prefer to explore possibilities by constructing and transforming 
state descriptions: graphic representations of the potential outcomes of fabrication processes. This 
preference is very understandable. It is easy to sketch, say, a milled stone column capital, but much 
more difficult to code the milling instructions, to understand that code when it is complete, and to 
explore variations on the theme by directly editing the code. Furthermore, a state description provides 
a convenient basis for analysis, visualization, and critical discussion. The preference of designers 
for working with state descriptions provided the original motivation for development of computer­aided 
design systems. In the 1950s, engineers at MIT and elsewhere began to imagine ways of constructing and 
editing three-dimensional shapes on computer screens, automatically generating fabrication instructions 
from that geometric information, and eventually executing those instructions on programmable machines 
to produce the required physical objects. How do designers construct these shapes on their screens? By 
inputting sequences of parameterized commands, of course. (They may do so by typing commands, or through 
gestures to a graphical user interface, but it comes to the same thing.) Generally, CAD systems preserve 
these input command sequences as undo trails. These are also process descriptions, but of a different 
kind from those that drive fabrication devices. They are expressed in terms of geometric entities, and 
transformations and combinations of those entities, that are meaningful to designers rather than to machines 
that apply tools to materials. Designers, for example, describe artifacts in terms of Euclidean geometric 
constructions, or NURBS surfaces, or Boolean operations on solids, whereas milling machines need descriptions 
in terms of tool paths for removing material from solid blocks, and three-dimensional printers need descriptions 
in terms of layers of polymer pellets. In other words, computer-aided design and fabrication requires 
translating a designer s process description into a stored state description that can support analysis, 
visualization, and discussion, and then re-translating that state description into a fabrication device 
s process description. Complexity The ratio of the length of the designer s process description to the 
length of the fabrication device s process description provides a useful measure of the complexity of 
the resulting fabricated artifact. (We can express this statement rigorously by carefully hedging it, 
but the intuitive idea will suffice here.) Simple artifacts are generated by CAD-system input sequences 
that are short relative to the output sequence of fabrication-device instructions. But with complex artifacts, 
the length of the designer s input sequence approximates that of the resulting sequence of fabrication-device 
instructions. How do designers create elegantly economical input sequences? By exploiting principles 
of order. A repetitive design, for example, can be specified very economically by first describing the 
repeating element, and then giving a repeat command with appropriate parameters. This does not take much 
work on the designer s part, but it creates a lot of commands for the fabrication device to execute. 
However, if a design is composed of arbitrarily located random shapes with no evident order then the 
designer s only option is to specify each shape and location explicitly. This may not result in any more 
instructions for the fabrication device to execute, but it requires a lot more input from the designer. 
 Insight In general though, there is no recipe for creating elegantly simple input to generate extensive 
and varied fabricated forms, just as there is no recipe for deriving elegantly simple scientific laws 
that describe widely varied phenomena. In both cases, it takes creative insight into underlying structure. 
Here, then, is a way of critically examining and understanding the artifacts on display in this show. 
For each one, try to imagine the shortest algorithm that would generate it. Then generalize, and imagine 
an algorithm that would produce variations on the theme. If you can come up with something clever and 
cogent, you have achieved a deep understanding of the piece.  Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38;

 SIGGRAPH 2008 ART &#38; DeSIGn GAlleRIeS | DESIGN &#38; COMPUTATION INTRODUCTION origins and ends: 
craftsmanship in the Work of Hauer and Rosado Phillip G. Bernstein AEC Vice President of Industry Strategy 
and Relations Autodesk, Inc. Lecturer in Practice Yale School of Architecture I drove out into the Connecticut 
countryside to visit Professor Erwin Hauer of Yale, who rents a non-descript red barn from the local 
water company as his studio in Bethany, outside New Haven. I studied with him in the 1970s, with many 
of my fellow architecture majors, in a class known as The Bone Course, where we examined the underlying 
structures of nature and attempted to create a few of our own. It was a precise discipline, and one not 
particularly suited to my adolescent brain. I remember well the struggles to complete tension assemblies 
of string and struts, but nothing of the results themselves. I lacked both the geometric acuity to create 
provocative results and the technical skills to build even my simple ideas. On my recent visit, as I 
walked through Professor Hauer s studio and examined the results of years of his much more enabled investigations, 
I found myself wishing I had taken his course in middle age. While the objects still seemed inaccessible 
(how does he imagine this stuff?), at least the logic was much more clear some 30 years later. Hauer 
s fascination with continuous surfaces and infinity are the heart of his work. He has labored for decades 
to perfect a series of fundamental geometries that extend, when repeated, in an infinite grid. They are 
comprised of formally simple but remarkably subtle weavings of continuous surface elements that appear, 
in their finished form, to be quite straightforward. But the clear, elegant forms have emerged from many 
years of experimentation and refinement in both process (casting concrete in carefully built, modular 
forms) and outcome (the elemental forms themselves). It is that intersection that led the curators of 
SIGGRAPH 2008 s Design &#38; Computation exhibit to include Professor Hauer s work. In partnership with 
Rick Rosado, he has begun to produce a new set of screens not with hand castings but through digital 
fabrication. In his introduction to the exhibit, Bill Mitchell describes the digital process as comprised 
of state descriptions, the originating digital geometry of a form, and parameterized commands, by which 
robots fabricate the resulting outcome. Hauer and Rosado are now exploring how to replace wooden design 
models and casting molds with three-dimensional computer models and the resulting tool paths necessary 
to manifest them. Where once enormous manual dexterity with tools combined with knowledge of materials 
was the technical platform (the underlying craft) of Hauer s process, software dexterity and intimate 
knowledge of the limitations of both modeling technology and fabrication machines have become the new 
craft of the digital age. Hauer and Rosado hope that redefining both the state descriptions and the parameterized 
commands to fabricate them will, in combination, reinvigorate the work. Those of us in the design-technology 
industry confidently presume that the tools that we produce are capable, essentially, of representing 
anything conceivable by a sculptor, architect, automobile designer, or even movie director. Since geometry 
is essentially computational, and today s tools are so powerful, where is the inherent challenge? And 
since software will translate that intent from form to realization so easily, is not an infinite number 
of formal possibilities apparent? My visit with Hauer and Rosado proved that these assumptions are, at 
best, completely wrong. In a recent symposium on the nature of design labor in the digital age, Columbia 
s Scott Marble explored the relationship between craft (the making of a desired artifact) and risk1 (the 
challenge of being able to execute a sustained process without error until the outcome is reached). He 
posited that digital tools might remove the risk that is in craft itself, since so much of the making 
process is predetermined not by analog tool actions but easily perfected software commands. Surely geometries 
perfected only by Hauer s intellect and skill in the mid-20th century are easily understood by the powerful 
technologies of the early 21st, where the risk is now gone? But alas, it isn t so, as their attempts 
to fabricate entire screens (including the pieces that you see in the show) have revealed. Risk has transferred 
from the refinement of the casting process to cajoling recalcitrant software and robots to get to the 
right results. It turns out that modeling and fabricating Hauer s infinite surfaces is devilishly complex 
2 as he and Rosado look for the right combination of software that can represent the original geometries, 
generate the correct tool paths, and meet the exacting standards that decades of refinement demand. It 
seems that computational conclusions about surface continuity and tension derived from fabrication software 
simply do not achieve these goals, and years will be invested in resolving approaches. Ironically, Hauer 
and Rosado have concluded that the process, which has recently resulted in an installation in a residential 
building in New York, is incredibly expensive, and they may indeed return to more traditional means of 
fabrication. We re fortunate that Hauer is as deft as ever in the casting studio. Observing Hauer reinvigorate 
his work with computation suggests an important change in the definition of craft itself. Hauer says 
that a three-dimensional idea is wonderful. But it is not any more important than the means to bring 
it into physical existence. For him, assembling parametric models and tuning fabrication tool paths might 
replace exploring via wood models and casting shapes with molds, but only if the results meet the exacting 
standards of his vision for the result. In the screens in the show, we rediscover the seductive nature 
of complex geometric form that he has understood all along. Digital tools now make the potential of those 
forms more accessible to all, but they will not provide the craft, what Bill Mitchell calls the creative 
insight into the underlying structure. Right now, for Hauer, that insight exceeds the ability of the 
tools to accomplish it, calling for a redefinition of craft itself. Professor Hauer and I exchanged email 
messages a few days after our visit, and he wrote: Now, in the digital age, you are way ahead of me in 
some ways, but we still have plenty of things to look at and to talk about and to explore. Isn t it wonderful? 
I m not so sure my digital colleagues and I are so far ahead, but I had to agree that, indeed, there 
is much left to accomplish, and that in itself is wonderful. 1. See David Pye, 1968, The Nature of Art

(artist) Kolam is a traditional Indian art form, executed by women, in which drawings are made at the 
entrances of the home. Known as Kolam in the south and Rangoli in the north, the drawings can be associated 
with the beginning of a celebration, an honor to a deity or other religious event, or simply to commemorate 
the beginning of a new day. Kolams are symmetric geometric patterns. Drawing them implies following precise 
procedures. Dots (pulli) are drawn first, and then straight lines or continuous curves (neli) are drawn 
around the dots to make the desired patterns. Different designs could be drawn with the same set of dots. 
The tradition and craft for drawing these algorithmic patterns is passed from mothers to daughters and 
has been for centuries. In South India, Kolams are created with rice flour. Colored powder is used in 
North India to draw Rangoli. Beyond being a way for women to display their drawing skills, this daily 
ritual is a representation of the women s agency and gender role in Indian society, in addition to being 
a means for personal expression. Through these ephemeral yet cyclical drawings, it is the women who invite 
and communicate with the outside world and the deities. Kolams, in essence, are a sort of painted prayer. 
Many women dedicate their Kolams to Lakshmi, the pan-Indian goddess of prosperity, fertility, and protection 
of the home. These drawings are also signs of invitation to the women s homes and symbols to prevent 
evil spirits from entering. Besides functioning as decoration, Kolams also serve as food source for ants 
and other insects thus inculcating a habit of caring for other lives. The month of Margazhi (15 December 
 15 January) is considered special for those interested in the art of Kolams. Early in the morning during 
Margazhi, the ground in front of the houses is cleaned and neighbors compete to draw the largest and 
most beautiful Kolam. It is common in India to hold these competitions throughout the year. Kolam designs 
have found their way into contemporary art and design forms such as clothing and jewelry, and they continue 
to be an integral part of the Indian culture. The generative aspect of Kolam creation has been researched 
by architects, computer scientists, and others. Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation

These relationships were investigated in Fourier Carpet, a 36-foot by 5-foot tapestry that was generated 
from multiple Fourier series. In this instance, the data are transformed into a CAD file of binary block

of music, color, and sound data. Data provided by the human body may also be woven. For example, when 
undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the human body emits a series of frequencies that are then 
filtered through a transform called the Fourier transform. Once filtered, the harmonic data emitted from 
the body are transformed into a static image. In the Body Blanket project, the output is more than a 
static image. The filter enables transformation of data along a curve into a material output. The discrete 
mathematics behind the Fourier series enables dynamic manipulations of material outputs. The Fourier 
transform is a useful tool for filtering and transform­ing generic data from points to waves to multiple 
woven waves, allowing for various representations of data. The transformation reveals a new interface 
between technology and the individual. design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design Galleries As one traces

spatial patterns within datasets that through study and analysis lead to multi-scalar textile tectonics. 
The process gives rise to questions regarding data imaging, technology, interface, and empowerment through 
materialized representation of information. Data are no longer represented as static images,

www.cabin-studio.com Branching Morphogenesis is an investigation of the relationship within branching 
structures formed by interacting vascular cells. The study and quantification of this network allows 
for greater understanding of how variable components give rise to structured networks in biology and 
architecture. The primary function of the lung is to provide gas exchange during our post-natal life. 
Determining how networks of blood vessels are generated and maintained during development represents 
a major challenge in contemporary lung biology. The aim of this project is to model the networking process 
involving blood vessels and airways in vitro. The resultant digital tools and structures are abstracted 
for architectural application. Using parameters that govern branching morphology, the study investigates 
how cell-to-cell and cell-to-underlying-extracellular matrix networking interactions develop. We have 
experimented with modification of parameters that prohibit networking behavior such as intercellular 
communication, environmental catalysts, and cellular geometry. Biology and architecture regularly borrow 
from each other. Tensegrity structures and geodesic domes have led to new insights into how living systems 
(such as eukaryotic cells, tissues, and organisms) are assembled and function, as well as to a new understanding 
of how the micro-ecology of cells influences the genome. Conversely, models found in biology, particularly 
relating to self-organization and the emergence of complex, non-linear, global systems from simple local 
rules of organization, have led to discovery of new forms and structural organizations in architectural 
design. The intent of this project is to jointly investigate fundamental processes in living systems 
and their potential application in architecture. Through investigation of cell-tissue biological models, 
algorithmic tools and digital models reveal the parametric logic inherent in biological and responsive 
systems. The result is a component-based networked surface architecture capable of responding dynamically 
to both environment (context) and deeper interior programmed systems.  Tensor Shades Sawako Kaijima 
Panagiotis michalatos Adams Kara Taylor 100 St. John Street London EC1M 4EH United Kingdom kaijima@gmail.com 
panhimic@gmail.com www.akt-uk.com The Tensor Shades are light shades generated by the interrogation of 
structural information (stress tensor field) and desired lighting information (inverse illumination field). 
The project explores a process that preconditions the design space by combining these two types of spatial 
information in order to create a design that maintains structural integrity and formal consistency. The 
inspiration for this project comes from our frequent professional observation of a disjunction in the 
relationships between design intentions, geometry, and structural consider­ations. This is partly a result 
of the division of disciplines within the design and construction industry, and reinforcement of such 
divisions by the employed methods and software tools. Such tools allow designers to create more complex 
forms than previous technologies could support, yet they treat the design space as homogeneous and isotropic 
Cartesian space. As a consequence, operations on a designed object tend to disregard its intrinsic properties 
and behavior, making integration and negotiation of concerns difficult. To overcome this problem, we 
have focused on the construction and interrogation of tensor fields that endow the design space with 
varying properties. Before developing a parametric model, we treat the ambient space itself as a generalized 
parameterization whose properties will affect and enrich the embedded objects. In effect, the form is 
the interpretation of the field that encompasses a multitude of concerns related to the particular design. 
SIGGRAPH 2008 attendees are invited to interact with a simplified version of the software tool developed 
for designing the Tensor Shades. The stress tensor field is extracted from the results of finite-element 
analysis of the volume material with given support and loading conditions. The inverse illumination field 
is left for the users to define. Each light shade is paired to one surface (wall, floor, or tabletop), 
on which users can designate their desired light intensities, which are projected back to the light through 
an inverse illumination process. The introduction of these fields allows for treatment of space as non-homogeneous 
and non-isotropic, and establishes a spatial condition that is variable and multi-dimensional. This complex 
spatial information is represented in various forms for the user to explore and interrogate a process 
parallel to that of designers reaching a well-integrated design solution for the Tensor Shades.  Art

experimented with modification of parameters that prohibit networking behavior such as intercellular 
communication, environmental catalysts, and cellular geometry. Biology and architecture regularly borrow 
from each other. Tensegrity structures and geodesic domes have led to new insights into how living systems 
(such as eukaryotic cells, tissues, and organisms) are assembled and function, as well as to a new understanding 
of how the micro-ecology of cells influences the genome. Conversely, models found in biology, particularly 
relating to self-organization and the emergence of complex, non-linear, global systems from simple local 
rules of organization, have led to discovery of new forms and structural organizations in architectural 
design. The intent of this project is to jointly investigate fundamental processes in living systems 
and their potential application in architecture. Through investigation of cell-tissue biological models, 
algorithmic tools and digital models reveal the parametric logic inherent in biological and responsive 
systems. The result is a component-based networked surface architecture capable of responding dynamically 
to both environment (context) and deeper interior programmed systems.  Tensor Shades Sawako Kaijima 
Panagiotis michalatos Adams Kara Taylor 100 St. John Street London EC1M 4EH United Kingdom kaijima@gmail.com 
panhimic@gmail.com www.akt-uk.com The Tensor Shades are light shades generated by the interrogation of 
structural information (stress tensor field) and desired lighting information (inverse illumination field). 
The project explores a process that preconditions the design space by combining these two types of spatial 
information in order to create a design that maintains structural integrity and formal consistency. The 
inspiration for this project comes from our frequent professional observation of a disjunction in the 
relationships between design intentions, geometry, and structural consider­ations. This is partly a result 
of the division of disciplines within the design and construction industry, and reinforcement of such 
divisions by the employed methods and software tools. Such tools allow designers to create more complex 
forms than previous technologies could support, yet they treat the design space as homogeneous and isotropic 
Cartesian space. As a consequence, operations on a designed object tend to disregard its intrinsic properties 
and behavior, making integration and negotiation of concerns difficult. To overcome this problem, we 
have focused on the construction and interrogation of tensor fields that endow the design space with 
varying properties. Before developing a parametric model, we treat the ambient space itself as a generalized 
parameterization whose properties will affect and enrich the embedded objects. In effect, the form is 
the interpretation of the field that encompasses a multitude of concerns related to the particular design. 
SIGGRAPH 2008 attendees are invited to interact with a simplified version of the software tool developed 
for designing the Tensor Shades. The stress tensor field is extracted from the results of finite-element 
analysis of the volume material with given support and loading conditions. The inverse illumination field 
is left for the users to define. Each light shade is paired to one surface (wall, floor, or tabletop), 
on which users can designate their desired light intensities, which are projected back to the light through 
an inverse illumination process. The introduction of these fields allows for treatment of space as non-homogeneous 
and non-isotropic, and establishes a spatial condition that is variable and multi-dimensional. This complex 
spatial information is represented in various forms for the user to explore and interrogate a process 
parallel to that of designers reaching a well-integrated design solution for the Tensor Shades.  Art

 Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) uncovers internal correlations and recursive relationships in its design 
practice at multiple scales, from the detailed to the urban. ZHA is systematically searching for parameters, 
laws of change, and tools for generating com-plexity to shift how architects approach form making and 
space design. Parametric Urbanism This project recruits powerful digital-design techniques to produce 
form and make urban spaces with an architect s sensibility. The design team uses recursive Maya scripts 
to generate a pattern that responds to varying environmental parameters. The result is a complex field 
for an urban context. The first step is to reconstruct the fundamental typological catalog of architecture 
and urbanism in terms of field conditions: point fields of villas, line fields of towers, plane fields 
of slabs, and volume fields of urban blocks. The second step calls for a series of parametric variations. 
In the final step, the designers play a Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation matrix game 
of recombination and interpenetration that generates the richness and complexity that makes an urban 
territorial strategy. ZHA has experimented with this approach in real-world projects at the Thames Gateway 
in London, in Istanbul, Turkey, in Singapore, and in Appur, India.  Procedural Complexity ZHA s in-house 
research group, the Computation and Design Group, brings designers and programmers together to develop 
specialized tools for generating spatial and experiential complexity in geometry. The group is experimenting 
with topological complexity, cellular logics, and field structures, among other domains. These explorations 
have resulted in new tools that are available to all the end-users at ZHA for projects at any stage of 
development. In other words, the tools address the entire design process from end to end and underscore 
the recursive nature and inner correlations that are a hallmark of ZHA s design.  As a competition entry,

 Phare Tower, la Défense marty Doscher and Satoru Sugihara Morphosis 2041 Colorado Avenue Santa Monica, 
California 90404 USA m.doscher@morphosis.net www.morphosis.net While the Eiffel Tower was shaped by the 
interaction of wind and gravity, towers today address more complex requirements that integrate multiple 
systems and serve a range of functions. The Phare Tower by Morphosis, an architectural practice headed 
by Thom Mayne, is a 300-meter skyscraper that will be built in the Paris district of La Défense in 2012. 
Phare is designed as a sustainable, performance-driven building. Scripting in software allows a design 
to be iteratively developed, tested, and refined to address multi-variant parameters. Rather than design 
each element, the architect inputs the given variables into the software; defines parameters by which 
to evaluate the aesthetics, cost or performance; and then selects from the multiple alternatives generated 
by the software. Changing a few variables can manifest in dramatic change over complex geometries. Computational 
design is used to adapt the diagonal grid (diagrid) of the structure and Phare Tower s non-standard form. 
The architect writes software that models the diagrid components or the louver system as an interconnected 
matrix. This multi­directional relationship of the matrix enables automation of global changes and suficient 
flexibility to work with intuitive human design. An iterative computational design process shaped the 
diagrid structural system in response to a number of variables. First, the geometry of the initial tower 
design was optimized for smooth­ness of the diagrid mesh, to create a seamless wrap of the tower. The 
smoothest form requires the maximum number of unique triangles in the mesh, so it is the most costly. 
The next iteration thus targeted cost, standardizing the structure by maximizing the incidence of the 
same triangle. Gaps between these standardized areas can still be seamlessly connected with the same 
smoothing optimization. Both the form and the orientation of the building respond to the path of the 
sun, to maximize energy efficiency. Traditionally, for optimal sun shading, louvers are angled perpendicular 
to the direction of the sun s path as calculated on the summer solstice. Yet the complexity of the tower 
s curving form and the louvers diagonal axis required that each louver be rotated at a unique angle and 
adjusted for a different time of day to achieve optimal sun shading. The power of the digital script 
is its ability to calculate the ideal rotation for each of the 5,000 louvers. To create a secondary scale, 
randomly selected louvers were slightly rotated, at an angle calculated for the winter solstice, creating 
a pattern of striations that sweep across the surface of the building. The result is a dynamic, high-performance 
skin that lives up to the name Phare, or lighthouse. Program: Commercial office tower with office space, 
employee restaurants, public cafe, trading floors, public amenities, and parking for 450 cars. Art &#38;

 A landscape of 3D-Printed Skyscrapers During a recent visit to an architecture studio, an architect 
remarked that she was writing the façade of the skyscraper she was designing. When asked what she meant 
by writing, she corrected herself and said that she was scripting it. The comment signified a shift in 
the ways designers conceptualize and detail a design. In addition to drawing by hand or modeling in CAD, 
she conceptualized the building with lines of code. The studio was packed with scale models of buildings, 
a common practice among architects. Some of these models were generated using digital fabrication methods. 
The availability and application of new fabrication methods coupled with the emergence of new software 
tools and the growing number of architects and designers who are familiar with computer programming have 
expanded possibilities for designs that are generative and parametric. It has also enhanced the ability 
to rapidly produce process models of these buildings. As part of the SIGGRAPH 2008 Design &#38; Computation 
gallery, we invited several architectural offices to contribute 3D-printed models of skyscrapers. These 
models vary in format, from completed projects to projects in progress, competition submissions, or concept 
work. Most of the designs were conceived using parametric and/or generative tools and scripting, both 
during form exploration and when the designers were evaluating structural, lighting, material, or other 
conditions relevant to the design and fabrication of the building. These towers represent a glimpse into 
the designers process, during which they created numerous iterations and variations of the design, and 
its overall form and façade articulation. Aesthetics, structural requirements, and environmental concerns 
are increasingly handled with sophisticated computational tools. Lira Nikolovska, S2008 Chair of Curated 
Art Lorna Goulden, S2008 Design Gallery Committee member This SIGGRAPH 2008 curated project was made

megacities forecast to exceed populations of 15 million by 2020. The Millennium Tower presents a timely 
solution to the social challenges of urban expansion on this scale and to the particular problems of 
Tokyo, with its acute land shortages. Commissioned by the Obayashi Corporation, the building rises out 
of Tokyo Bay. The tower is capable of housing up to 60,000 people, generating its own energy, and processing 
its own waste. Developed in response to the hurricane­strength wind forces and earthquakes for which 
the region is notorious, the tower s conical structure, with its helical steel cage, is inherently stable. 
It provides decreasing wind resistance toward the top, where it is completely open, and increasing width 
and strength toward the base to provide earthquake resistance. location Tokyo, Japan Design 1989  Millennium

to the dynamic high-rise skyline of Moscow. The 600-meter building continues the firm s investigation 
into the nature of the tower, taking structural, functional, environmental and urban logic to a new dimension. 
The mixed-use project incorporates apartments, hotel, office, and leisure space, and it will have an 
energy cycle that pioneers sustainable architecture and reinforces the economic and social vitality of

 Grimshaw Architects Tower Concept A Grimshaw Architects Tower Concept B Contact: Shane burger 100 Reade

Contact: Shane burger 100 Reade Street New York, New York 10013 USA shane.burger@grimshaw-architects.com 
www.grimshaw-architects.com The design concept is a balance of three requirements: reflect the traditions 
of Islamic vernacular architecture, create a building with multiple functions and internal villages, 
and provide an intelligent response to a hot, humid climate. The layering of these factors creates the 
building s character. The Tower adapts the vernacular mushrabiyah screen to create comfortable internal 
conditions with minimal energy consumption. The resulting screen provides the proper level of light and 
reduction of heat gain, which is appropriate for the variety of internal program conditions, all within 
a vernacular textural framework that references the rich history of Islamic geometry.  Beginning with 
complex zoning and right-to-light requirements, this tower concept explores the performative development 
of a paired-blade, double-skin façade. The macro-scale environmental form is enhanced by micro-scale 
exterior-actuated louvers that track 3D printing of Grimshaw sun movement and interior heat gain, and 
provide a naturally comfortable interior year-round while preserving the prevailing views. Architects 
models was made possible through a donation from York Technical College / 3D Systems 26 Art &#38; Design

 The Search of form, the Search of order: Gaudí and the Sagrada familia Carlos barrios School of Architecture 
and Planning The Catholic University of America 620 Michigan Avenue, NE Washington, DC 20064 USA barrios@cua.edu 
architecture.cua.edu The architecture of Antoni Gaudí is commonly associated with the Art Nouveau movement 
of late 19th-century Europe. Perhaps this association is due to the exuberance of the forms and their 
capricious appearance, or maybe it can be attributed to the use of picturesque and natural motifs in 
combination with vernacular solutions. Some experts even regard Gaudí s work as the precursor of Catalonian 
modernism. Nevertheless, behind the seemingly erratic appearance of complex forms and spaces, Gaudí s 
work epitomizes the synthesis of plain shapes and simple geometrical operations. The interior and exterior 
of his buildings offer a collection of unique spatial experiences. His inno­vative architectural language 
is the result of a unique combination of geometrical operations most evident in his work on the Expiatory 
Temple of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. The Sagrada Familia, still under construction, started as 
a small parochial church of neo-Gothic style in 1862. The original architect resigned only a year after 
being commissioned and Gaudí was hired to complete the project and oversee its construction in 1863. 
Gaudí, known to have been a critic of the Gothic style, took a bold, ambitious approach, changing both 
the style and scale of the project. The Sagrada Familia became a project that consumed Gaudí for the 
next 43 years until his accidental death in 1926. He spent the final 12 years of his life declining other 
commissions and remained exclusively devoted to the completion of the Sagrada Familia. Most of the work 
was done in plaster models that still survive and provide documentation of the architect s original vision. 
For the columns of the Sagrada Familia, Gaudí initially proposed a single helicoidal shape. However, 
he became concerned that the single twist was visually inappropriate, since it produced a column that 
looked weak and could be squashed or deformed when loaded to compression. The visual imperfection of 
the single twisted column bothered Gaudí for a number of years and inspired a search for an alternative 
solution. After years of experimentation, he applied two simultaneously opposite rotations. This approach, 
which has no known precedents in architecture, was the result of eight years of work and experimentation. 
Gaudí s inspiration for the helicoidal growth can be found in plants; it is believed that he studied 
the growth of abelia, a plant abundant in Barcelona. The double-twisted column was based on a single 
rotation of a basic shape and the corresponding counter-rotation of the same shape. When the two shapes 
were superimposed and intersected, the resulting shape created a new emergent form. All the columns on 
the Sagrada Familia nave follow this process. The only variations can be found in the degree of rotation, 
the height of the columns, and the initial shape used to generate the columns. A hierarchical arrangement 
of the columns is present throughout the temple. The columns of the central nave use an octagonal shape; 
the columns of the crossing area are two pentagons forming a 10-sided polygon. The central columns on 
the crossing are three squares forming a 12-sided polygon and the columns of the lateral nave are made 
of two triangles to form a hexagon. With today s computer-modeling systems, it is fairly easy to reproduce 
Gaudí s original columns and to explore possible new designs using variations of the initial shape and 
degree of twist, as well as the use of irregular forms and non-symmetrical shapes. 3D printing of the 
models for this curated project was made possible through a generous donation from Z Corporation. Contact:

 Continua erwin Hauer enrique Rosado EHR Associates LLC www.erwinhauer.com The concepts of continuity 
and potential infinity have been central themes of Erwin Hauer s opus from very early on in his career 
as a sculptor. In his native Vienna, he began to explore infinite continuous surfaces that evolved into 
perforated modular structures that were appropriate in architectural applications. Hauer s sculptural 
walls are intricately woven forms that create a visual sense of infinity a frozen poetry in motion. 
He patented these designs, developed the technology to produce them, and installed the modular, light-diffusing 
walls in buildings through­out the United States and seven other countries. Hauer continued this work 
after he moved to the US, first as a Fulbright scholar and then as a faculty member in the Department 
of Design at Yale University, where he was invited by Josef Albers, a giant of modernism and one of the 
pillars of the Bauhaus. Hauer derived the concept of continuous surface primarily from his studies of 
biomorphic form, an experience reinforced by his first encounters with the work of Henry Moore. He examined 
how Moore interlaced the dominant continuity of surfaces with an unprecedented cultivation of interior 
spaces within his sculptures. These reflections led Hauer to the awareness of the so-called saddle surface, 
a type of mathematical surface that looks like the peculiar shape of horse saddles that curve both up 
and down. These surfaces influenced his sculptures and soon evolved into a repeat pattern because, as 
Hauer states, the saddle surface refuses to permit the closure of form. While Naum Gabo accepted this 
fact, Hauer responded to the open-endedness of the single saddle by adding replicas of it around its 
boundaries, in a seamless and flush manner. When this procedure is repeated for every open-ended edge, 
the result is in an infinite continuous surface. This characteristic is central to most of Hauer s screen 
designs. In 2003, Hauer formed a partnership, Erwin Hauer Studios, with Enrique Rosado, a former student 
of his at Yale who has extensive knowledge in the digital field. Their purpose is to re-issue a selection 
of Hauer s original screens of the 1950s, to adapt some of these classic designs to modern production 
methods using digital technology, and to develop new designs as well. With the same intensity and scrutiny 
Hauer applied to his original molds and casts, Enrique Rosado now focuses on design transformations, 
creation of custom tools, and CNC-milling techniques. fabricators Digital Stone Project and others Art

 Weaving Public and Private: Interior Wall Studies Contact: neil Katz Skidmore, Owings &#38; Merrill 
LLP 14 Wall Street, New York New York 10005 USA neil.katz@som.com www.som.com This interior wall panel 
was designed for an SOM client from the Middle East. It is conceived as a 25-meter-long and 15-meter-tall 
screen that consists of solid, repeating Corian components that hang together structurally and weave 
public and private spaces. The resulting divider is a thickly layered and textured screen that generates 
the project-appropriate degree of visual transparency. The system functions as both surface and structure 
thanks to the interplay between geometry and material. Corian is an artificial material that is typically 
used as a slab in architectural settings. Here, the designers worked with Corian fabricators to push 
the material s structural capabilities and to explore the potential Design Skidmore, Owings &#38; Merrill 
LLP (SOM) fabrication Evans &#38; Paul Unlimited Corp Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation 
of digital fabrication. The resulting geometries are consistent with the ways Corian can be produced 
and manipulated, but open new possibilities for structural applications. Instead of cutting off public 
from private spaces, the wall mediates between the two. The solid component pieces are woven together 
like fabric, and link one side to the other physically and visually. The three-dimensional texture and 
repeating pattern of the surface allow variation when viewed from different vantage points or in motion. 
This dynamic experience is dramatically reinforced under different lighting conditions. Islamic Patterns 
Craig S. Kaplan Computer Graphics Lab University of Waterloo csk@cgl.uwaterloo.ca www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk 
The rise and spread of Islamic culture from the 7th century onward has provided us with one of history 
s great artistic and decorative traditions. Across Europe, Africa, and Asia, we find artistic treasures 
of unrivaled beauty in calligraphy, stylized floral designs, architecture, and abstract geometric star 
patterns. Islamic star patterns adorn buildings, part- icularly mosques and tombs, throughout the Islamic 
world. Design methods for construction of Islamic patterns were the private domain of the artisans who 
practiced them. The knowledge was passed down from master to apprentice over generations and ultimately 
was lost as the practice declined during the 15th century. Except for a few scattered remnants of this 
technical knowledge, the design of Islamic star patterns is a mystery. As a guide, we have only the end 
product: hundreds of beguiling geometric designs found all over the world. One thing known with certainty 
is that star patterns are deeply mathematical in nature. The artisans were well versed in geometry; in 
their pursuit of mathematical knowledge, early Islamic scholars translated Euclid s Elements into Arabic. 
And so even though we cannot peer back through time to understand their design techniques, we can at 
least be confident that their constructions were firmly rooted in geometry. In the past 100 years or 
so, many mathematicians and hobbyists have studied the construction of Islamic star patterns. The result 
is a small set of practical techniques that can be used to generate traditional and novel star patterns, 
techniques that may or may not resemble those practiced historically. Craig Kaplan develops software 
for design and rendering of Islamic geometric patterns. His work is inspired both by historical examples 
and by contemporary research into the mathematical structure of these patterns. Kaplan s software marries 
algorithms from computer graphics with the modern mathematical machinery of symmetry theory and tiling 
theory. His work breaks the process of pattern construction into two steps. First, the designer chooses 
a tiling of the plane. Then the software places small geometric motifs in every tile, a process governed 
by a small set of parameters under the designer s control. The motifs link together to form a finished 
design. The computer handles the tedium of precise, repetitive drawing, thus freeing the human designer 
to explore the space of star patterns quickly and enjoyably. Kaplan s work provides an opportunity to 
extend the range and scope of Islamic star patterns beyond the boundaries of the historical canon. Non-Euclidean 
geometry would have been inconceivable hundreds of years ago. Kaplan has shown how star patterns can 
be adapted to the hyperbolic plane and the sphere. His Islamic parquet deformations exhibit a slow geometric 
evolution in space. The mathematical technique is straightforward, but it would have been impractical 
to produce these designs without computers because of the lack of strict repetition. The connection between 
computer graphics and computer-controlled manufacturing offers the exciting possibility of realizing 
computer­generated art as physical artifacts. Kaplan has experimented with sculptural, architectural, 
and decorative forms using a variety of manufacturing technologies and media.  design &#38; computation

of unrivaled beauty in calligraphy, stylized floral designs, architecture, and abstract geometric star 
patterns. Islamic star patterns adorn buildings, part- icularly mosques and tombs, throughout the Islamic 
world. Design methods for construction of Islamic patterns were the private domain of the artisans who 
practiced them. The knowledge was passed down from master to apprentice over generations and ultimately 
was lost as the practice declined during the 15th century. Except for a few scattered remnants of this 
technical knowledge, the design of Islamic star patterns is a mystery. As a guide, we have only the end 
product: hundreds of beguiling geometric designs found all over the world. One thing known with certainty 
is that star patterns are deeply mathematical in nature. The artisans were well versed in geometry; in 
their pursuit of mathematical knowledge, early Islamic scholars translated Euclid s Elements into Arabic. 
And so even though we cannot peer back through time to understand their design techniques, we can at 
least be confident that their constructions were firmly rooted in geometry. In the past 100 years or 
so, many mathematicians and hobbyists have studied the construction of Islamic star patterns. The result 
is a small set of practical techniques that can be used to generate traditional and novel star patterns, 
techniques that may or may not resemble those practiced historically. Craig Kaplan develops software 
for design and rendering of Islamic geometric patterns. His work is inspired both by historical examples 
and by contemporary research into the mathematical structure of these patterns. Kaplan s software marries 
algorithms from computer graphics with the modern mathematical machinery of symmetry theory and tiling 
theory. His work breaks the process of pattern construction into two steps. First, the designer chooses 
a tiling of the plane. Then the software places small geometric motifs in every tile, a process governed 
by a small set of parameters under the designer s control. The motifs link together to form a finished 
design. The computer handles the tedium of precise, repetitive drawing, thus freeing the human designer 
to explore the space of star patterns quickly and enjoyably. Kaplan s work provides an opportunity to 
extend the range and scope of Islamic star patterns beyond the boundaries of the historical canon. Non-Euclidean 
geometry would have been inconceivable hundreds of years ago. Kaplan has shown how star patterns can 
be adapted to the hyperbolic plane and the sphere. His Islamic parquet deformations exhibit a slow geometric 
evolution in space. The mathematical technique is straightforward, but it would have been impractical 
to produce these designs without computers because of the lack of strict repetition. The connection between 
computer graphics and computer-controlled manufacturing offers the exciting possibility of realizing 
computer­generated art as physical artifacts. Kaplan has experimented with sculptural, architectural, 
and decorative forms using a variety of manufacturing technologies and media.  design &#38; computation

 Ice-rays George Stiny Department of Architecture Massachusetts Institute of Technology stiny@mit.edu 
architecture.mit.edu/computation.html Ice-rays are a kind of traditional Chinese lattice used in ornamental 
window grilles (figure 1).1 Ice-rays form irregular patterns that suggest cracking ice on still water 
 straight lines meet longer lines in myriad ways. Rules for ice-rays are easy to define in a shape grammar.2 
They are in two equivalent schemas: x -> div(x) and x -> x + x , where x, x , and x are triangles, quadrilaterals, 
or pentagons, and div(x) divides x into x and x . Sample rules are in figure 2. Rules apply in alternative 
ways. Imagine a Chinese craftsman at a building site, with his tools and a trove of sticks. Shown a window 
opening, he starts an ice-ray. He selects a stick of the right size and inserts it between two sides 
of the rectangular frame to form two quadrilaterals. He continues his work by dividing one of these areas 
into a triangle and a pentagon. Then he divides the triangle into a triangle and a quadrilateral, and 
the pentagon into a quadrilateral and a pentagon. He goes on connecting sides of polygons to make others 
of the same kind. Everything is stable in this process, if he keeps to the rules. It is striking how 
rules apply recursively, but also notice something new. Calculating in a shape grammar is visual. Rules 
apply directly to ice-rays. There are no hidden representations that limit what you can do what there 
is, you can see, and what you see is there. Divisions in ice-rays may vary some require multi-axial 
figures and motifs (figures 3 and 4). Just put them in rules: draw what you see before you divide, and 
then draw what you want. Or let the schema x -> div(x) include your rules, so that polygons are divided 
into two areas or more. The ice-rays in this exhibit were made using CNC milling. There is no end to 
the ice-rays you can get from the schema x -> div(x): both known ones, and ones that are new. Go on and 
try the schema make an ice-ray of your own! 1. Daniel Sheets Dye, 1949, A Grammar of Chinese Lattice,

 African Kuba Textiles: Structural Inference and Contemporary Design using Shape Grammars The Generative 
Design Team Cheryl Kolak Dudek Margarita Lypiridou Nasim Sedaghat Sudhir Mudur Fred Szabo Lydia Sharman 
Thomas Fevens Concordia University Montréal, Québec, Canada  While many cultures create designs with 
geometric patterns, each has distinct motifs and symmetries. The textiles by the Kuba ethnic groups in 
southeastern Congo are unique in their iterations and transformations of basic geometric shapes. These 
textiles, woven from the fiber of the raphia palm, reveal a sophisticated vocabulary of geometric patterns. 
This project illustrates application of a generative model to interpret the geometric structure inherent 
in Kuba textiles by ascribing a shape grammar, to create contemporary design variations through grammar 
variations, and finally to fabricate the new designs on a computerized loom. Kuba textile designs can 
be described as compositions of simultaneous diversity. Women artisans incorporate spontaneity and improvisation 
in their designs to achieve uniqueness and individuality part of their cultural aesthetics. The designs 
are most often characterized by semi-symmetry, achieved by the juxtaposition of distinct geometric motifs, 
and by controlled variations in texture, scale, shape, orientation, and/or color. As the knowledge and 
skills of elder generations die out, analysis of these art forms generates considerable interest in the 
contemporary design and arts community. Shape grammars provide a powerful paradigm both for representing 
the structural complexity in existing designs, like Kuba, and for creating contemporary variations. They 
also Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation provide a structured mechanism to express the 
recursion inherent in the artwork. Arrangements are formally captured as a finite sequence of Euclidean 
transformations (translation, rotation, scale, and reflection). Coloring techniques in the artwork are 
expressed as properties of basic shapes. Texturing, blending, and fading are employed as the primary 
coloring techniques. By traversing the grammar s language or reworking grammars, artists, designers, 
and historians can wander freely in the neighborhood of an existing design, exploring variations and 
discovering elements that define the character of an existing pattern. By modifying a pattern to replicate 
another existing design, the artist or researcher can get a hands-on feel for the similarities and differences 
between them. The end product of such work may be new patterns or simply a better understanding of the 
ones under examination. It is possible to generate interesting families of artworks by simple variations 
in their grammar rules. A child grammar may even retain the exact pictorial specification, but modifying 
coloring rules may yield a new design through different blending, line traits, or color assignments. 
Once new designs are specified using modified shape grammars, pictorial specifications can be used to 
drive a computerized Jacquard loom and fabricate new designs. Acknowledgements This work is supported

Student Research Team Kenfield Griffith Ayodh Vasant Kamath Steve Preston Tal Goldenberg The objective 
of this project is the development of new kinds of low-cost, high-quality, mass­customizable building 
assembly systems that provide visually rich design variations for housing and other small structures. 
The building systems are intended to be tailored for particular cultures and communities by incorporating 
local, vernacular, decorative design into the assembly design. Two complementary areas of computational 
design are brought together in this work: shape grammars and digital fabrication. The visual, aesthetic 
aspects of the research are explored through shape grammars. The physical design and manufacturing aspects 
are explored through advanced digital design and fabrication technologies, and, in particular, they build 
on recent work on mono-material, interlocking, component-based assemblies with parts that can be fabricated 
with CNC machines and assembled easily by hand. The long-term objective is development of visual­physical 
design grammars with rules that generate complete CAD/CAM data for fabrication of full-scale components 
for assembly design variations. If successful, the results of this research will lead to new solutions 
for economical, easily manufactured housing, which is especially critical in developing countries and 
for post-disaster environments. These new housing solutions will not only provide shelter, but will also 
support important cultural values through the integration of familiar visual design features. The use 
of inexpensive, portable digital design and fabrication technologies will allow local communities to 
be active participants in the design and construction of their homes. Beyond the specific context of 
housing, visual-physical grammars have the potential to positively affect design and manufacture of artifacts 
at many scales, and in many domains, particularly for artifacts where visual aesthetics need to be considered 
jointly with physical or material requirements and design customization or variation is important. A 
proof-of-concept study was initiated to establish the potential of this research. A visual, vernacular 
language of ancient Greek meander designs is the basis for the study. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from 
a grammar that generates a language of meander variations. The grammar rules generate a wide range of 
meander patterns (Figure 2) by stacking, shifting, and reflecting rows of meanders. This two­dimensional 
visual language was then translated into a three-dimensional building system. The components of the system 
are uniquely designed meander bricks (Figure 3). The components have integrated alignment features so 
that they can be easily fitted and locked together manually without binding materials. The meander bricks 
were 3D printed at desktop scale with a layered manufacturing machine to assess the visual and structural 
feasibility of the system. Figure 4 shows a wall being assembled. Figure 5 shows some of the many different 
meander-wall patterns that can be generated with the system. The next steps of this study include construction 
of a full-scale mockup of a wall section and development of an automated visual-physical grammar for 
machine fabrication of full-scale components for wall-pattern variations. This research will undoubtedly 
open up new questions and provide the foundations for the longer-term, broader project on assembly systems 
for complete houses and other small-scale structures. We are grateful for the support we are receiving 
for this project through a SGER grant from the national Science foundation (grant number 0748992). Art

dfab.arch.ethz.ch Four hundred square meters of the brick façade on a winery were digitally designed 
and fabricated to serve as a prototype for this process. The masonry façade functions both as a temperature 
buffer and as protection from direct sunlight. The robotic construction technology, developed at the 
ETH Zürich by Gramazio &#38; Kohler, Architecture and Digital Fabrication, lays individual bricks according 
to programmed parameters, precisely at the desired angle and at exact prescribed intervals. With this 
new digital production method, each wall was constructed to the desired light and air permeability specifi-cations, 
while creating a pattern of individually rotated bricks. The façade is made up of 20,000 bricks. Each 
individual brick reflects light differently, depending on the angle at which it is set, and thus has 
different light-diffusion characteristics. Much like pixels on a computer screen, the bricks form a pattern 
on the façade. In contrast to a two-dimensional screen, however, there is a dramatic play among plasticity, 
depth, and color, depending on the viewer s position and the angle of the sun. At closer view in contrast 
to its pictorial effect at a distance the sensual, textile softness of the walls dissolves into the 
materiality of the stonework. The observer is surprised that the soft, round forms are actually composed 
of individual, hard bricks. The façade appears as a solidified dynamic form. In the interior, the daylight 
creates a mild, yet luminous atmosphere. The image of the landscape glimmers through the open gaps between 
the bricks. To create the façade, the team designed a generative process using the animation software 
Maya and its embedded scripting language, MEL. The existing concrete-frame construction was interpreted 
as a basket and filled with abstract balls (representing grapes) that varied in diameter. By digitally 
simulating gravity, the process simulated balls falling into a virtual container. The digital basket 
was then viewed from all four sides, and the digital image data were automatically transferred as a rotation 
of the individual bricks. The joints were left open to create transparency. In the built result, the 
visitor sees gigantic, synthetic grapes, as if they were inside the vineyard building. The wall elements 
were manufactured as part of a pilot project at the robot research facilities at the ETH Zürich, transported 
by lorry to the con- struction site, and installed with a crane. The Gramazio &#38; Kohler team wrote 
a script for direct post­processing of the generated design data into robot control language. The robot 
is directly activated by the design data, and there was no need to produce additional implementation 
drawings. As a result, the team was able to continue working on the façade up to the very last minute 
before starting production. Architecture Bearth &#38; Deplazes with Gramazio &#38; Kohler facade Gramazio

www.joshuadavis.com  Tropism is a biological phenomenon that descibes the movement of a plant or flower 
in response to a stimulus. Here, Tropism is a collaborative project that bridges the techniques and visions 
of two digitally oriented art and design studios: Commonwealth and Joshua Davis. Commonwealth s language 
of form, generated within animation software, became the genesis of the Tropism porcelain vases. Output 
as SLA rapid-prototyped models, Commonwealth s design was directly translated from digital idea to material 
object. These rapid-prototyped prints were taken to Boehm Porcelain, a traditional fine-bone porcelain 
maker, and cast into a series of digitally driven porcelain vases. Graphic compositions, created by freezing 
rule-based, animated programs written by Joshua Davis, were digitally output as sheets of ceramic paint 
and fired into the porcelain surface of the vase. Davis graphics, inspired by Arthur Harry Church s Types 
of Floral Mechanics, are algorithmic compositions of colors and forms produced by rule-driven systems. 
The printed sheets of graphic paint were fused into the figurative surfaces of Commonwealth s porcelain. 
The kiln-fired result is a series of unique objects demonstrating a kind of creative exchange facilitated 
by digital-design techniques and tools.  Joshua Davis giclée watercolor prints were produced using the 
same generative techniques as those used to produce the graphic paint sets that were fired into the porcelain 
vases. This created a fluid relationship between print and object, and between planar graphic and porcelain 
form. In all senses of the term, tropism describes an exposure to stimulus. Commonwealth, known for their 
experimental products and form, and Joshua Davis, known for his generative graphics, collaborated to 
create a work that expresses multiple tendencies within art and computational design. Painted and Glazed

www.materialise-mgx.com www.assaashuach.com The Omi.MGX lamp is part of the Materialise.MGX design collection. 
The lamp, a single 3D-printed nylon object, is one of the first products to be produced and distributed 
directly from a selective laser-sintering machine. Its form, together with the natural flexibility of 
the polyamide, creates the impression of a biological mechanism. The versatile shape can be transformed, 
personalized, and manipulated to create different sculptural sensations, spaces, and moods. Ratio.mGX 
naomi Kaempfer Materialise.MGX Technologielaan 15 3001 Leuven, Belgium www.materialise-mgx.com The design 
for Ratio.MGX is the result of a study of phyllotaxis (the principles governing leaf arrangement), mathematical 
structures, and the rational and irrational distribution patterns in nature. The lamp, together with 
the electric cables, rests unconnected in a concrete base. This allows the lamp to be taken out of its 
base and carried around like a torch. Ratio.MGX is the rational part of a twin design. The irrational 
counterpart has not yet been released. design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design Galleries  Art &#38;

www.materialise-mgx.com www.assaashuach.com The Omi.MGX lamp is part of the Materialise.MGX design collection. 
The lamp, a single 3D-printed nylon object, is one of the first products to be produced and distributed 
directly from a selective laser-sintering machine. Its form, together with the natural flexibility of 
the polyamide, creates the impression of a biological mechanism. The versatile shape can be transformed, 
personalized, and manipulated to create different sculptural sensations, spaces, and moods. Ratio.mGX 
naomi Kaempfer Materialise.MGX Technologielaan 15 3001 Leuven, Belgium www.materialise-mgx.com The design 
for Ratio.MGX is the result of a study of phyllotaxis (the principles governing leaf arrangement), mathematical 
structures, and the rational and irrational distribution patterns in nature. The lamp, together with 
the electric cables, rests unconnected in a concrete base. This allows the lamp to be taken out of its 
base and carried around like a torch. Ratio.MGX is the rational part of a twin design. The irrational 
counterpart has not yet been released. design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design Galleries  Art &#38;

www.materialise-mgx.com The One_shot.MGX foldable stool, designed by Patrick Jouin, was produced for 
the design collection of Materialise MGX. It was created with rapid-prototyping and rapid-manufacturing 
technologies, and provides an example of the application of these processes within the discipline of 
industrial design. The stool is made from polyamide, using a 3D printing technology known as selective 
laser sintering. The seating surface and the legs of the stool emerge from the machine in one shot, as 
do the hinges, which are concealed within the structure of the stool. With a simple, elegant twist, much 
like opening an umbrella, the array of vertical elements transforms into a stool. Strato Anna Silberschmidt

 Studio Aphorisma combines innovative designs and processes that push the boundaries of contemporary 
textile design. The studio collaborates with internationally renowned fashion and interior design companies 
and institutions such as the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, for which the Studio recreated two Bauhaus textiles 
for the reconstructed Gropius Room. Strato is a collection of textile-based jewelery and accessories 
created on a computer-controlled loom. The designs explore the links among materials, new technologies, 
and traditional crafts. The resulting textiles reflect a deep knowledge of materials and craftmanship, 
while the process represents an innovation in contemporary design. Strato consists of two contrasting 
elements: a flat, rigid silver bracelet and a soft, flexible tube of woven silver threads. The tube is 
woven on a computer-controlled loom with light and dark silver threads, and the weave fully encapsulates 
the structural silver bracelet. Together, the two elements create a soft, flexible structure that makes 
the bracelet reconfigurable. The design sets rigidity in opposition with softness, stiffness with maleability, 
and two-dimensionality with three-dimensionality. The overall design balances the hard and soft elements 
 making the piece exciting in both a visual and a tactile way. The woven patterns reflect both flexible 
structure and changing surface. Through its maleable structure and response to lighting conditions, the 
piece constantly reconfigures itself. This flexibility allows Strato to transform with inexhaustible 
variation. Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design

 mathematical Sculptures bathsheba Grossman Bathsheba Sculpture LLC 3127 Branciforte Drive Santa Cruz, 
California 95065 USA b@bathsheba.com bathsheba.com I am often asked whether my designs originate in 
logic or intuition, and the answer must be both: my intuition is guided by logic, and it seeks order 
and symmetry. The sculptures come into existence as visualizations, which are translated into virtual 
3D models. They enter the physical world by various computer­mediated manufacturing processes (in the 
case of these pieces, 3D metal printing). Lastly, they are hand finished by assembling, burnishing, or 
any other craft methods that may be required. Thus the process moves backward in history: from imminent 
idea to high technology to hand-finished metal. Because the originals of my work are data, they transcend 
location, medium, and time, and they move us away from the history-bound, privileged­original model of 
art making. Art can now take its value from its inherent nature without reference to time, place, or 
artificial scarcity. ora, metatrino and Soliton Gyroid Bathsheba Grossman Bathsheba Grossman Alan Schoen 
 Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation We are standing at the Gutenberg moment for sculpture, 
where to be digital is to be nameless yet immortal. These designs honor the emergence of sculpture as 
a digital medium, sounding a timeless note of purity and symmetry at this pivotal moment in the history 
of art. The material of these sculptures is a sintered steel-bronze composite metal manufactured by Ex 
One s Prometal process, then hand-finished in my shop. Software includes Rhinoceros, Mathematica, Surface 
Evolver, Materialise Magics, and Perl scripts written by me. The Gyroid, Schwartz surfaces and the Snub 
24-Cell are purely algorithmic; the remaining three designs are non-computed ( handmade CAD models). 
Schwartz D-Surface Snub 24-Cell Bathsheba Grossman Bathsheba Grossman Henry Cohn, Microsoft XuRf, HyperSurfaces 
Haresh lalvani Pratt Institute Brooklyn, New York 11205 USA hlalvani@aol.com XURF XURF (eXpandable sURFace) 
is an experiment in developing a performative surface with the emergent properties of curvature, strength, 
porosity and transparency. Constructed from continous sheet materials metal, in this instance XURF 
exemplifies a morphable rigid curved surface. Possible in regular as well as irregular pattern geometries, 
XURF can be variably formed by controlling the interplay between force and form. The patent pending XURF 
system was invented by Haresh Lalvani in 1998 and has been under development since with Milgo. It is 
a highly scalable invention with applications ranging from nano and micro scales to product design and 
architecture. We envision XURF as yardage (as in textiles) so that responsive architectural skins can 
be tailored. Smart XURF, with digitally operable components, are a natural possibility. fabricator and 
Sponsor Milgo-Bufkin www.milgo-bufkin.com  HyperSurfaces In 1981, Haresh Lalvani developed a geometric 
generalization of the Penrose tiling as a projection from higher dimensions. This work led to his discovery 
and subsequent patenting of a large class of number-coded convex and non-convex tessellations embodying 
the generative paradigm Shape by Number . Milgo-Bufkin has introduced HyperGrills as one application 
of Lalvani s tiling designs in laser-cut sheet metal. In the 80 s and 90 s, Lalvani extended these tessellations 
into large classes of 3-dimensional structures that could be constructed from systems of nodes, struts 
and panels. These patented inventions were amongst the first examples of modular construction systems 
enabling irregular and fractal spatial geometries in the building arts. Included amongst these were Lalvani 
s HyperSurfaces, a new mathematical class of surface subdivisions that combined aperiodic tilings with 
any curved surface. The example of a hypersurface panel-system shown here is constructed from laser-cut 
stainless steel components. We are looking to extend these into active and passive smart structures in 
view of our interest in responsive architecture. design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design Galleries

3D models. They enter the physical world by various computer­mediated manufacturing processes (in the 
case of these pieces, 3D metal printing). Lastly, they are hand finished by assembling, burnishing, or 
any other craft methods that may be required. Thus the process moves backward in history: from imminent 
idea to high technology to hand-finished metal. Because the originals of my work are data, they transcend 
location, medium, and time, and they move us away from the history-bound, privileged­original model of 
art making. Art can now take its value from its inherent nature without reference to time, place, or 
artificial scarcity. ora, metatrino and Soliton Gyroid Bathsheba Grossman Bathsheba Grossman Alan Schoen 
 Art &#38; Design Galleries design &#38; computation We are standing at the Gutenberg moment for sculpture, 
where to be digital is to be nameless yet immortal. These designs honor the emergence of sculpture as 
a digital medium, sounding a timeless note of purity and symmetry at this pivotal moment in the history 
of art. The material of these sculptures is a sintered steel-bronze composite metal manufactured by Ex 
One s Prometal process, then hand-finished in my shop. Software includes Rhinoceros, Mathematica, Surface 
Evolver, Materialise Magics, and Perl scripts written by me. The Gyroid, Schwartz surfaces and the Snub 
24-Cell are purely algorithmic; the remaining three designs are non-computed ( handmade CAD models).

is an experiment in developing a performative surface with the emergent properties of curvature, strength, 
porosity and transparency. Constructed from continous sheet materials metal, in this instance XURF 
exemplifies a morphable rigid curved surface. Possible in regular as well as irregular pattern geometries, 
XURF can be variably formed by controlling the interplay between force and form. The patent pending XURF 
system was invented by Haresh Lalvani in 1998 and has been under development since with Milgo. It is 
a highly scalable invention with applications ranging from nano and micro scales to product design and 
architecture. We envision XURF as yardage (as in textiles) so that responsive architectural skins can 
be tailored. Smart XURF, with digitally operable components, are a natural possibility. fabricator and 
Sponsor Milgo-Bufkin www.milgo-bufkin.com  HyperSurfaces In 1981, Haresh Lalvani developed a geometric 
generalization of the Penrose tiling as a projection from higher dimensions. This work led to his discovery 
and subsequent patenting of a large class of number-coded convex and non-convex tessellations embodying 
the generative paradigm Shape by Number . Milgo-Bufkin has introduced HyperGrills as one application 
of Lalvani s tiling designs in laser-cut sheet metal. In the 80 s and 90 s, Lalvani extended these tessellations 
into large classes of 3-dimensional structures that could be constructed from systems of nodes, struts 
and panels. These patented inventions were amongst the first examples of modular construction systems 
enabling irregular and fractal spatial geometries in the building arts. Included amongst these were Lalvani 
s HyperSurfaces, a new mathematical class of surface subdivisions that combined aperiodic tilings with 
any curved surface. The example of a hypersurface panel-system shown here is constructed from laser-cut 
stainless steel components. We are looking to extend these into active and passive smart structures in 
view of our interest in responsive architecture. design &#38; computation Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Curved origami Jeannine mosely j9mosely@gmail.com Folding along curves is very different from folding 
straight lines. The most important difference is that when you make a curved crease, the two parts of 
the paper that lie on opposite sides of the crease cannot be made to lie flat against each other. So 
while in conventional origami, facets of the paper become layered and hidden, in curved origami most 
of the paper remains exposed to view. This usually results in larger spans of paper that must be self 
supporting, so even the materials used are different: most origami paper is as thin as possible, while 
curved origami often requires very heavy paper or card stock. I strive to create designs in which complexity 
arises from the interaction or repetition of simple shapes, so that the results are both immediately 
comprehensible and unexpected. I begin with experimentation: I put some creases in the paper, bend it 
and see what shapes interest me. Shall I repeat the shapes symmetrically or transition to a different 
shape? How will the regions interact with each other, and what can be done with the paper between two 
regions to allow a smooth transition, without stretching or crumpling the paper? By modeling paper as 
an idealized mathematical surface and applying theorems from differential geometry, we can develop methods 
for analyzing and designing curved origami shapes. Paper can be represented as a developable surface, 
which means that no matter how you fold or bend it, at every point on the surface it is possible to embed 
a straight line in the surface passing through the point. Developable surfaces may be planes, general- 
ized cylinders or cones, or tangent surfaces. Intuition tells us that we cannot fold a sphere from a 
piece of paper, and yet the tops of the triangular pillows in Sails (see image and crease pattern) appear 
to be domed. Look closely, and you will see that they are in fact equilateral triangles with three tapering 
cylindrical sections attached. On the other side of the three curved creases are three cones that all 
come to a point below the center of the dome. These units are connected with a planar tiling of triangles. 
All the component surfaces are developable. Even for models where the curves are all circular arcs, like 
Sails, the length and position of those arcs cannot be calculated without computer assistance. The constraints 
imposed to guarantee that the repeated units will tile the plane require us to numerically solve an equation 
containing an elliptic integral. Since the parameter solved for is not algebraic, we also need the computer 
to plot the resulting curves. I use Mathematica for these tasks. Because of the malleability of paper, 
it is often possible to construct curved models that do not conform to theory, but I feel that such models 
incorporate a kind of lie that even the eye of the untutored viewer can detect, and that designs founded 
in mathematics have a greater appeal, as they reveal that truth visually.  Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Figure 1 When contained in a fuel cell and fed with metabolized sugar, a micro-organism, rhodoferax 
ferrireducens, produces an electrical current. The current is produced as the electrons freed in the 
process accumulate on an electrode in the fuel cell. Based on this principle, we have designed a series 
of power-generating objects made of sugar. The objects contain the current-producing microbes and produce

sugar objects slowly evolve and change shape as the microbes inside metabolize the sugar. This figure 
shows the objects being made and how they might be used. Technology is often touted as the solution to 
a host of problems, not least our over-reliance on fossil fuels and the spectre of global warming. But 
what will it be like to live with the emergent technologies that are being devised to combat these threats? 
It seems the proposed solutions, and especially the more experimental and speculative, have the potential 
to alter our relationships with technology (sometimes radically). Take, for example, some of the efforts 
to rethink the production and consumption of power. These proposals not only move us away from consuming 
oil, coal, gas, and the like. They also allude to machines that will operate at a very different pace 
and rhythm because of their energy-production cycles. This installation encourages audiences to consider 
one such alternative to power production, namely microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and, in doing so, encourage 
reflection on a broader class of so-called energy autonomous technologies. MFCs rely on the breakdown 
of organic material by a microbial substrate and production of an electrical charge via this process. 
The organic material might be a simple compound (for example, sugar or something more complex such as 
fruit, vegetables, or even insects). The substrate can consist of sludge similar to that found in the 
common pond. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | erosion Life and Death of Energy- Autonomous Devices 
 Figure 2 This large-scale radio is a design for a conceptual appliance. The radio contains several 
microbial fuel cells that generate an electrical charge to power the appliance. The radio is large so 
as to incorporate the required cells to produce a sufficient charge. The funnel at the top of the radio 
is used for feeding the cells microbes with rotten food, insects, and most other forms of naturally occurring 
organic material. The pot at the bottom end of the radio s digestive system collects any waste, which 
in turn can be used to feed plants. The view of the rear of the radio shows how the cells contain a microbe-rich 
sludge, and how the organic matter used to feed the microbes can pass along and be recycled through the 
system. Our installation presents a range of artifacts and media designed to encourage questions and 
debate around the developments in energy autonomous systems and their use. One collection of artifacts 
consists of three electricity-producing objects designed to be fueled using sugar (Fig. 1). These sugar-based 
objects provoke questions about our relationship with power sources that contain living microbes, but 
that have a fixed life span. Another of our designs considers the production of electricity by incorporating 
the cells into a radio appliance (Fig. 2). Unlike the sugar-based cells, the radio is designed to run 
on cells that will last indefinitely, so long as they are supplied with organic material. This promised 
longevity of power supply is one of the distinctive features of MFCs. Our radio is designed to use a 
microbial substrate that will break down most organic material, including complex materials. Through 
this process, the microbial substrate is conditioned over time to operate most efficiently with particular 
sources of energy. This conditioning is related, in part, to the history of the materials the cells are 
supplied with. Thus the radio s life cycle and performance interleaves with its usage patterns and the 
timeframe of use, both expanding well beyond the immediate interactions one has with the radio. Shawn

 Figure 1 When contained in a fuel cell and fed with metabolized sugar, a micro-organism, rhodoferax 
ferrireducens, produces an electrical current. The current is produced as the electrons freed in the 
process accumulate on an electrode in the fuel cell. Based on this principle, we have designed a series 
of power-generating objects made of sugar. The objects contain the current-producing microbes and produce 
a charge when carbon electrodes are inserted into them. Rather than existing as static things, these 
sugar objects slowly evolve and change shape as the microbes inside metabolize the sugar. This figure

 In my Faces of Chaos series, I seek to visualize a chaotic dynamical system, using a unique mapping 
of the Lyapunov exponent to the image plane. Tiled Faces is one result of this exploration, and its 1,024 
images combine to reveal the face of the four-dimensional system s chaotic behavior. This emergent figuration 
draws the viewer in, closer to the surface, where a myriad of individual faces is revealed. Because I 
approach the challenge of representing four dimensions from an aesthetic perspective, I am free to bring 
the underlying equations to light, to visually and intuitively understand them. Tiled Faces juxtaposes 
order and chaos, artistic sensibility and mathematical depth, within its pixels and pigments. ErosIon

 Gregory Shirah The Verge Columbia, Maryland USA gshirah@gmail.com We are facing a global climate crisis. 
This piece symbolizes our environmental underpinnings that could collapse in the near future unless we 
accept global responsibility and act. In the past, global climate change was thought of as a slow process. 
However, in recent years this slowness has been hotly debated. A contrast is drawn between the complex 
balance of global climate change issues using an accessible, familiar approach: a house of cards. Satellite 
images of the Earth are used with accessible themes such as sea ice and cloud patterns. The implication 
is that complexity realized in this piece was very slow in developing and that the construction was a 
very slow, tedious process. A future history is represented where many of the environmental underpinnings 
have already given way, allowing the observer to experience the null space where components have disappeared. 
How close is this future history to our present? Satellite images courtesy of the MODIS Rapid Response 
Project at NASA/GSFC. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | ErosIon Water Planet  Anna ursyn University 
of Northern Colorado Greeley, Colorado USA aursyn@gmail.com Our planet holds mostly water. In the water, 
much as in our lives, changes are slow yet difficult to keep up with. As we grow up, we hear stories 
about goodness and bravery, un-won battles and new lands unconquered for simple but unexplainable reasons. 
We envision joy on a princess face when she is presented with silk and pearls sent on a ship under big 
white sails. We embolden the prince in shining armor, on a white horse, to fight a dragon and win a princess 
whose portrait is in a talisman he carries. These tales vary depending on the culture, but they create 
values that we can translate into contemporary media to help us understand reality. We transform old 
cultural information to meet the needs of the present audience; works of literature are remade as movies; 
traditional stories are retold with new metaphors and annotations; histories are modified and retold 
in ways that mollify, rather than inflame, an audience. ErosIon | slow art Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Gregory Shirah The Verge Columbia, Maryland USA gshirah@gmail.com We are facing a global climate crisis. 
This piece symbolizes our environmental underpinnings that could collapse in the near future unless we 
accept global responsibility and act. In the past, global climate change was thought of as a slow process. 
However, in recent years this slowness has been hotly debated. A contrast is drawn between the complex 
balance of global climate change issues using an accessible, familiar approach: a house of cards. Satellite 
images of the Earth are used with accessible themes such as sea ice and cloud patterns. The implication 
is that complexity realized in this piece was very slow in developing and that the construction was a 
very slow, tedious process. A future history is represented where many of the environmental underpinnings 
have already given way, allowing the observer to experience the null space where components have disappeared. 
How close is this future history to our present? Satellite images courtesy of the MODIS Rapid Response 
Project at NASA/GSFC. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | ErosIon Water Planet  Anna ursyn University 
of Northern Colorado Greeley, Colorado USA aursyn@gmail.com Our planet holds mostly water. In the water, 
much as in our lives, changes are slow yet difficult to keep up with. As we grow up, we hear stories 
about goodness and bravery, un-won battles and new lands unconquered for simple but unexplainable reasons. 
We envision joy on a princess face when she is presented with silk and pearls sent on a ship under big 
white sails. We embolden the prince in shining armor, on a white horse, to fight a dragon and win a princess 
whose portrait is in a talisman he carries. These tales vary depending on the culture, but they create 
values that we can translate into contemporary media to help us understand reality. We transform old 
cultural information to meet the needs of the present audience; works of literature are remade as movies; 
traditional stories are retold with new metaphors and annotations; histories are modified and retold 
in ways that mollify, rather than inflame, an audience. ErosIon | slow art Art &#38; Design Galleries

 HybRIDS the objects in this section draw strength from unique combinations. when joined, these objects 
create timeless subjects rich with contrasts. they are at once nostalgic and innovative, natural and 
artificial, known and unknown. It is through these contrasts that we are drawn toward a deeper understanding 
of the familiar. The Echo Locations project is a series of site-specific installations utilizing motion 
sensing to invite observers to slow down, give the site their attention, and be still long enough for 
ghostly images to form of how people have moved through the site in the past. The project builds on motion 
capture, particle systems, and slow interaction techniques developed for Will.0.w1sp. However, whereas 
the Will.0.w1sp characters move through motion sequences captured in a studio, Echo Locations makes a 
stronger link to specific locations by capturing motion in real life. The characters recreated by the 
particle software become similar to ghosts repeating movements that once occurred in the location. Only 
when visitors to the site are still and quiet do the projections reform and return to their movements. 
The intention of the piece is to use interaction to make visitors reflect on their personal impact on 
an environment as they move through a location, and to hint at its history. The installation uses sound 
in an attempt to awaken curiosity and invite visitors to various locations. The audio environment mixes 
samples recorded onsite together with simple melodies to create echoes of past inhabitants. If visitors 
to the site are calm and still, these sounds are played out very melodically, but if visitors move around 
or make noise of their own, the sound from the particle flows becomes very sharp, with aggressive scratches 
and hisses. Just as the motion of the particle dancers evokes the site s past history, so does the audio 
environment. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | ErosIon HYbrIDs

Looking into another person s eyes, also known as eye contact, is a powerful means of forming connection, 
intimacy, and trust. Unfortunately, it is emotionally difficult to achieve. Eye contact arouses strong 
emotions, so typical eye contact lasts three seconds at a stretch. Breaking eye contact reduces stress 
levels, but also, sadly, reduces intimacy. The Intimacy Machine mediates intimacy, allowing people to 
overcome their normal social boundaries. The machine is a reciprocal high-technology peep show where 
eye contact is routed through a computer. In particular, it provides an indirect mechanism for people 
standing in close proximity to each other to stare at each other directly in the eyes, a feat that otherwise 
proves tremendously difficult for humans. Whereas telesex offers a way for people far away to feel close, 
the intimacy machine makes it possible for people who are close to feel distant. Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Associative Audio Design Dennis de bel Piet Zwart Institute, Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam University 
of Applied Science Rotterdam, The Netherlands info@danos.nl These associative objects are derived from 
similarities in form and function of everyday items, as well as wordplay. Retro components, perhaps considered 
futuristic in their time, are re-formed to create new, contemporary devices illuminating the dialogue 
between art and design. NAAITAFEL(sewing table) is a combination of functions. Instead of a needle from 
a record player, a sewing­machine needle is used. NOOTZUIGER(note sucker) is a harmonium (air organ) 
built into a device that also uses air pressure to operate a vacuum cleaner. STRATENSPELER(street player) 
is a device that makes urban patterns and textures audible. A microphone is used together with rotation 
to create an audio loop of the particular surface it s placed on. fragment.0140.02b ( Silhouette )  
tim borgmann fragment.1207.0304.3 ( Glint ) Independent Artist Wuppertal, Germany info@bt-3d.de The images 
of the fragment.series are an attempt to create dynamic forms and capture tension and beauty as they 
evolve. Creation of these images begins with a particle simulation. After defining conditions for the 
motion and behavior of the particles, I run a simulation and observe the process until I find a shape 
I am interested in. At that point, I freeze the shape and take it out of its dynamic context. Unlike 
real-life photography, I can easily change the simulation conditions, play the simulation forward or 
backward, in slow motion, or high speed, or I can orbit with the camera while searching for an interesting 
form or moment. I don t plan the image. The product is the result of computation and some controlled 
manipulation. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | HYbrIDs HYbrIDs | slow art Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Associative Audio Design Dennis de bel Piet Zwart Institute, Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam University 
of Applied Science Rotterdam, The Netherlands info@danos.nl These associative objects are derived from 
similarities in form and function of everyday items, as well as wordplay. Retro components, perhaps considered 
futuristic in their time, are re-formed to create new, contemporary devices illuminating the dialogue 
between art and design. NAAITAFEL(sewing table) is a combination of functions. Instead of a needle from 
a record player, a sewing­machine needle is used. NOOTZUIGER(note sucker) is a harmonium (air organ) 
built into a device that also uses air pressure to operate a vacuum cleaner. STRATENSPELER(street player) 
is a device that makes urban patterns and textures audible. A microphone is used together with rotation 
to create an audio loop of the particular surface it s placed on. fragment.0140.02b ( Silhouette )

 RealSnailMail [RSM] There are those who turn on their televisions to see if it is raining just outside 
the window. Vicariously, many viewers readily accept what they see on television as personal experience. 
Billions watch television screens religiously for many hours daily. The cathode ray tube has become a 
glass-faced altar. Courtesy of Televisor Museum International teleseum.org  RSM, a research project 
developed by Vicky Isley and Paul smith (aka boredomresearch), is the world s first use of live snails 
to carry electronic messages across physical space. boredomresearch aim to premiere the world s first 
web-mail service to use live snails for carrying electronic messages across physical space. Visitors 
to the Slow Art exhibition can access the realsnailmail.net web site and send email messages. Each message 
travels at the speed of light to the realsnailmail.net server, where it enters a queue. It waits there 
until a real snail in the tank at Bournemouth University wanders within range of a hot spot. The hot 
spot is the dispatch centre in the form of an RFID reader. This reader identifies the snail from the 
RFID chip attached to its shell and checks that it has not already been assigned a message to carry. 
RSm Contributors: web Developer Tim Orman electronic engineer Andrew Watson The School of Design, Engineering 
and Computing Bournemouth University If the snail is available, it is assigned the message at the top 
of the list, then slips away into the technological wasteland. Located at the other end of the tank is 
the drop-off point. When, or if, the snail ever makes it there, it is identified by another reader, which 
then forwards the relevant message to the recipient s email address, once again at the speed of light. 
At each stage of the message s transit, the sender is updated with its progress, and when it finally 
arrives at its destination, it is appended with details of its carrier and a log of its journey. The 
realsnailmail.net web site encourages users to consider the efforts of a diminutive mollusc lugging their 
messages across a tank, and for this reason urges them to send a message of value. During SIGGRAPH 2008, 
a SnailCam shows live video of the snails in action. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | HYbrIDs HYbrIDs

 Cross-Being: Dancer (The Spinning Screen) Hyun Jean lee Ali mazalek Georgia Institute of Technology 
Atlanta, Georgia USA hyunjean@gmail.com mazalek@gatech.edu In screen-based experiences, the screen itself 
can become an interactive element. The move­ability of the screen affords interactivity between the screen 
artifact and the viewer, and between the virtual space and the physical space. Cross-Being: Dancer features 
a movable screen interface, a spinning screen based on a two-sided monitor mounted on a revolving base. 
User interactions with the spinning screen can support diverse temporal and spatial responses, thereby 
enriching users experiences. The spinning screen enables viewers to grasp the interplay between visibility 
and invisibility, creating an aesthetic experience. The angle and direction of rotation affects the displayed 
visuals and audio output. Inspired by a toy for young girls a ballerina figure on a spinning plate 
a virtual dancer on-screen spins along with the physical screen as the user spins it. Cross-Being: Dancer 
aims to explore the doubling effect of visual illusion that takes place between the physical and virtual 
worlds, and between visibility and invisibility. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | HYbrIDs TimeFrames: 
Digital  wil lindsay Magic Lantern Slides Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA wm.lindsay@gmail.com By looking 
at past technologies, we are able to better understand our current technology-driven pace of life. The 
TimeFrames image series is created from a purely digital emulation of the long-extinct Magic Lantern 
slide format of the late 1800s. This older photographic technology made use of slow collodion chemistry, 
which, in contrast to contemporary CCD-based digital cameras, often took minutes to capture an image. 
The slow image-capture process often eliminates the fast motion of humanity and machines from the very 
landscape a photographer hopes to document. This can encourage the viewer to reflect on the condition 
of our very lives. And yet this aesthetic anomaly is rarely achievable with the fast-capture digital 
cameras of today. As high-speed digital photography supplanted the older chemical-based technologies, 
the long-exposure image and its aesthetic was left to history. The TimeFrames digital lantern slides 
were created using a process borrowed from astronomical photography. The process starts with a digital 
video camera capturing hundreds to thousands of individual fast frames, and then algorithmically compressing 
them to a single image frame. This creates a perceived single exposure of many minutes, far beyond the 
capabilities of a single-image digital camera. The resulting image is digitally printed to toner and 
transferred to glass via a heat process. This transfer process causes a premature aging of the image, 
giving the overall image an antiquated look. HYbrIDs | slow art Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Cross-Being: Dancer (The Spinning Screen) Hyun Jean lee Ali mazalek Georgia Institute of Technology 
Atlanta, Georgia USA hyunjean@gmail.com mazalek@gatech.edu In screen-based experiences, the screen itself 
can become an interactive element. The move­ability of the screen affords interactivity between the screen 
artifact and the viewer, and between the virtual space and the physical space. Cross-Being: Dancer features 
a movable screen interface, a spinning screen based on a two-sided monitor mounted on a revolving base. 
User interactions with the spinning screen can support diverse temporal and spatial responses, thereby 
enriching users experiences. The spinning screen enables viewers to grasp the interplay between visibility 
and invisibility, creating an aesthetic experience. The angle and direction of rotation affects the displayed 
visuals and audio output. Inspired by a toy for young girls a ballerina figure on a spinning plate 
a virtual dancer on-screen spins along with the physical screen as the user spins it. Cross-Being: Dancer 
aims to explore the doubling effect of visual illusion that takes place between the physical and virtual 
worlds, and between visibility and invisibility. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | HYbrIDs TimeFrames: 
Digital  wil lindsay Magic Lantern Slides Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA wm.lindsay@gmail.com By looking 
at past technologies, we are able to better understand our current technology-driven pace of life. The 
TimeFrames image series is created from a purely digital emulation of the long-extinct Magic Lantern 
slide format of the late 1800s. This older photographic technology made use of slow collodion chemistry, 
which, in contrast to contemporary CCD-based digital cameras, often took minutes to capture an image. 
The slow image-capture process often eliminates the fast motion of humanity and machines from the very 
landscape a photographer hopes to document. This can encourage the viewer to reflect on the condition 
of our very lives. And yet this aesthetic anomaly is rarely achievable with the fast-capture digital 
cameras of today. As high-speed digital photography supplanted the older chemical-based technologies, 
the long-exposure image and its aesthetic was left to history. The TimeFrames digital lantern slides 
were created using a process borrowed from astronomical photography. The process starts with a digital 
video camera capturing hundreds to thousands of individual fast frames, and then algorithmically compressing 
them to a single image frame. This creates a perceived single exposure of many minutes, far beyond the 
capabilities of a single-image digital camera. The resulting image is digitally printed to toner and 
transferred to glass via a heat process. This transfer process causes a premature aging of the image, 
giving the overall image an antiquated look. HYbrIDs | slow art Art &#38; Design Galleries

 Neurosymphonic Self Reflection Kevin mack Divine Instruments of Technology Los Angeles, California 
USA info@kevinmackart.com  My work is an exploration of the sublime beauty of infinity, complexity, 
perception, and consciousness. I have a passionate fascination for the powerful visions that inspire 
this exploration. By creating imagery that exists at the threshold of recognition, I seek to invoke the 
unconscious imagination of the viewer and inspire a personal experience of awe and mystery. I endeavor 
to provide a purely aesthetic escape from worldly meanings, messages, and agendas. The content and meaning 
of my art are derived from each viewer s own psyche. This perceptual phenomenon causes a shift in consciousness 
that can quiet our normal mental chatter and still the mind. I ve developed and refined my process over 
many years. Digital paintings and 3D animations are transformed using 3D math functions to create evolving 
abstract dimensional objects and spaces of vast complexity. From within these spaces, I compose high-resolution 
images and animations. My process integrates intuition and intellect, deliberate design and random happen-stance, 
realism and abstraction, humanity and technology, painting and math, science and mysticism. Abstract 
Dimensionalism describes the inspiration, the style, and the process. Chorus  Paul magee London, England 
paul@p000m0000.com Chorus continuously reinterprets and sings through the structure of the first passage 
of St. John s Gospel. Using the phonetic structure of this text as a template, the program assigns a 
random consonant to each consonant position and a random vowel to each vowel position. Pauses between 
words and at the end of sentences are preserved. Assigning each of the three speakers a separate channel 
and a separate note F, C#, and G the computer then sings its new construction of consonants and vowels. 
Once finished, it loops back to the beginning of the code and starts the whole process again. My thanks

 Fold Loud Joo youn Paek Eyebeam Resident New York, New York USA jypaek@gmail.com Fold Loud connects 
ancient traditions and modern technology by combining origami, vocal sound, and interactive technology. 
It involves folding origami shapes that produce soothing harmonic vocal sounds. Each fold is assigned 
to a different vocal sound so that combinations of folds create harmonies. Users can fold multiple Fold 
Loud sheets together to produce a chorus of voices. Open circuits made out of conductive fabric are visibly 
stitched onto the sheets of paper, which creates a meta-technological aesthetic. When the sheets are 
folded along crease lines, a circuit is closed like a switch. Thus, the interface guides participants 
to use repetitive delicate hand gestures such as flipping, pushing, and creasing. Fold Loud invites users 
to slow down and reflect on their physical senses by crafting paper into both geometric origami objects 
and harmonic music. Digital Drawings  Ross Racine New York, New York USA ross@rossracine.com My drawings 
do not contain photographs nor scanned material. They are drawn freehand directly on a computer and printed 
on a high-end inkjet printer. My practice is an inherently hybrid process, mixing the languages of drawing 
and computer imaging to bring together some familiar opposites such as handmade and technological, organic 
and mechanical, physical and virtual. The subjects of my work may be interpreted as models for planned 
communities as much as aerial views of fictional suburbs. The images reference the computer as a tool 
for urban planning as well as image capture. They raise questions about the relationship between design 
and actual lived experience, subverting the implied rationality of urban design to expose conflicts that 
lie beneath the surface. These drawn digital works are a comment on the fears as well as the dreams expressed

 Solargrafica Andreas Zingerle Interface Culture Department, University of Art and Industrial Design 
Linz, Austria www.interface.ufg.ac.at/interface/ RHytHmS rhythms are the patterns that adorn our journey 
from one point in time to the next. a breath, a heartbeat, a note from a song, have no significance without 
a reference to what comes before and after. these projects document patterns in time and add an element 
of play. at once disruptive and hopeful, their rhythms present the potential for a new examination of 
time and space. Solargrafica records the paths of the sun by using a lens-less camera with exposure times 
up to five months. With this process, the invisible movements of the sun can be made visible as landscapes. 
A soundscape processed with granular synthesis samples creates a time-space relationship between light 
and sound. The visitor can interact with the sound by moving within the installation and focusing on 
the different camera modules. The Interface Culture master and doctoral program at the University of 
Art and Industrial Design was founded in 2004 by Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau.  Art &#38;

London, England joey@xslabs.net dimainstone@hotmail.com www.xslabs.net/skorpions SKORPIONS are a collection 
of kinetic electronic garments that use the shape-memory alloy Nitinol to move and change on the body 
in slow, organic motions. They have anthropomorphic qualities and can be imagined as parasites that inhabit 
the skin of the host. They breathe and pulse, controlled by their own internal programming. They are 
living behavioral kinetic sculptures that exploit charac­teristics such as control, anticipation, and 
unpredictability. SKORPIONS integrate electronic fabrics, soft electronic circuits, specially designed 
circuit boards, Nitinol, mechanical actuators such as magnets, and traditional textile construction technique. 
The cut of the pattern, the seams, and other construction details become an important component of engin- 
eering design. SKORPIONS are not interactive: their programming does not respond to sensor data. SKORPIONS 
shift and modulate personal and social space by imposing physical constraints on the body. They alter 
behavior, by hiding or revealing hidden layers, inviting others inside the protective shells of fabric, 
by erecting breathable walls, or tearing themselves open to divulge hidden secrets. An XS Labs production

 Graph Theory FF- Jason Freeman David Gladstein Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, Georgia USA 
jason.freeman@music.gatech.edu Contemporary technological and aesthetic developments challenge us to 
play a more engaged and active role as cultural consumers. We help create the content we enjoy: we curate 
the playlists we listen to, we compete in the online games we play, and we collaboratively filter the 
media we watch. Within this context, traditional concert performance, particularly of classical and contem­porary 
music, seems increasingly anachronistic. Audiences sit in dark halls, often looking at a con- ductor 
whose back is turned toward them, afraid to cough or sneeze lest they disturb their neighbors. Graph 
Theory aims to bridge this experiential gap. Through its availability on the internet, Graph Theory creatively 
engages audiences outside the concert hall. The project incorporates their activities into the context 
of a live concert performance. Web site visitors, who need not have specialized musical training, use 
a visual interface to navigate short, looping musical fragments to create their own unique path through 
the open-form comp­osition for solo violin. Before each concert performance, the live performer, a violinist, 
visits the web site to print out a new copy of the score, the linear fragments of which are ordered based 
on the decisions made by site visitors. Graph Theory is a commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, 
Inc. (aka Ether Ore) for its Turbulence web site. It was made possible with funding from the Greenwall 
Foundation. I created this work in collaboration with designer Patricia Reed and violinist Maja Cerar. 
 San Francisco, California USA gladstein@gladstein.com This animation was a happy accident. I was interested 
in seeing what kinds of shapes could be generated by simple L-systems, so I coded a Python/PyQt application 
to iterate the replacement rule and draw the resulting string using the typical turtle geometry interpretation. 
I quickly saw that changing the angle parameter about a degree could produce very different shapes, and 
that haphazard exploration of the angle parameter might miss interesting shapes. So I added an animation 
feature to vary the angle systematically and save out the resulting frames. By trial and error, I settled 
on .01 degree as an increment that produced a small but noticeable change in the picture. I rendered 
the 18,000 frames into a movie for review and was surprised to find that at 30 frames per second the 
animation was interesting and fun to watch for 10 minutes, and that the eye could easily pick out single-frame 
shapes that differed substantially from the neighboring frames. 94  Art &#38; Design Galleries slow

 Graph Theory FF- Jason Freeman David Gladstein Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, Georgia USA 
jason.freeman@music.gatech.edu Contemporary technological and aesthetic developments challenge us to 
play a more engaged and active role as cultural consumers. We help create the content we enjoy: we curate 
the playlists we listen to, we compete in the online games we play, and we collaboratively filter the 
media we watch. Within this context, traditional concert performance, particularly of classical and contem­porary 
music, seems increasingly anachronistic. Audiences sit in dark halls, often looking at a con- ductor 
whose back is turned toward them, afraid to cough or sneeze lest they disturb their neighbors. Graph 
Theory aims to bridge this experiential gap. Through its availability on the internet, Graph Theory creatively 
engages audiences outside the concert hall. The project incorporates their activities into the context 
of a live concert performance. Web site visitors, who need not have specialized musical training, use 
a visual interface to navigate short, looping musical fragments to create their own unique path through 
the open-form comp­osition for solo violin. Before each concert performance, the live performer, a violinist, 
visits the web site to print out a new copy of the score, the linear fragments of which are ordered based 
on the decisions made by site visitors. Graph Theory is a commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, 
Inc. (aka Ether Ore) for its Turbulence web site. It was made possible with funding from the Greenwall 
Foundation. I created this work in collaboration with designer Patricia Reed and violinist Maja Cerar. 
 San Francisco, California USA gladstein@gladstein.com This animation was a happy accident. I was interested 
in seeing what kinds of shapes could be generated by simple L-systems, so I coded a Python/PyQt application 
to iterate the replacement rule and draw the resulting string using the typical turtle geometry interpretation. 
I quickly saw that changing the angle parameter about a degree could produce very different shapes, and 
that haphazard exploration of the angle parameter might miss interesting shapes. So I added an animation 
feature to vary the angle systematically and save out the resulting frames. By trial and error, I settled 
on .01 degree as an increment that produced a small but noticeable change in the picture. I rendered 
the 18,000 frames into a movie for review and was surprised to find that at 30 frames per second the 
animation was interesting and fun to watch for 10 minutes, and that the eye could easily pick out single-frame 
shapes that differed substantially from the neighboring frames. 94  Art &#38; Design Galleries slow

 KASHIKOKIMONO -Ver.J­ takahiro Hayakawa Kyushu University Fukuoka, Japan haya-02@iamas.ac.jp The words 
animation and animism both derive from the Latin word anima, which means life principle or soul. This 
work is a visual expression of the triangular realm formed by these three words. Animism here represents 
Asia s ancient religion, and the title, Kashikokimono, stands for the innumerable gods and deities of 
Japan. With this work, I have tried to create images that express this profusion of gods representing 
all of creation. With the goal of creating a new type of organic visual expression, I used a combination 
of hand-drawn animation and software-based generative animation. 2006.7 (Elemental Series)  Kenneth 
Huff Savannah College of Art and Design Savannah, Georgia USA ken@kennethahuff.com There are many natural 
events I find fundamentally intriguing: for example, sparks flying from embers of a fire, waves of lightning 
rolling in a thunderstorm, or trees swaying in a breeze. With sustained observation of these events, 
I find myself in a meditative state, relaxed but also actively, mindfully engaged. I develop my work 
to explore similar ephemeral phenomena, to gently abstract their essences, and to create new contemplative 
experiences. I evoke many overlapping natural rhythms and time scales, from the darting of our eyes as 
we take in the world to the ever-changing rhythms of our breathing, from the breaking of waves to the 
changing of seasons. In this work inspired by underwater patterns of light, life, and movement, we are 
accompanied by a series of companions, one constant, others slowly passing as they emerge from the darkness. 
The exact subject matter is kept purposefully ambiguous, encouraging a broad range of associations.

 Prelude Qian li Cleveland State University Cleveland, Ohio USA qian@qiandesign.com www.qiandesign.com 
 This video, inspired by a dream, is the life story of two humanized dots discovering love and hardship 
in today s society. The piece intends to evoke personal memories that are emotionally tied to the viewer 
s own experiences. The visuals are strongly influenced by traditional Chinese brush painting. The rising 
and falling life of the dots is synchronized with the music, with the intent that they empower one another. 
The piece mixes classical music with cutting-edge technology to create a deeply unique experience. Trained 
as a traditional Chinese painter, I have adopted the principle of expressing the spirit through form. 
Along with painting, I have studied Chinese philosophy and researched Buddhist art. During the past few 
years, I have traveled to Dunhuang and Tibet to study their art and attempt to understand their spirit, 
both visually and philosophically. These themes in art and lyrical composition have served as the foundation 
for my work as a new media artist. Phantasm  takahiro matsuo Monoscape Fukuoka, Japan matsuo@monoscape.jp 
 Explore a fantasy world experience at some time, somewhere in our memory. Phantasm is an interactive 
installation in which participants are illuminated in a small, dreamlike space. As you grasp a glowing 
sphere, the area lights up in pale blue light, and white butterflies appear from nowhere as a soft piano 
melody flows. Butterflies fly slowly and gloriously, gathering toward the sphere, and chase you as you 
move the sphere. The sphere is the key to the real world and fantasy. Participants can experience the 
nostalgia of playing with butterflies by moving around or holding the sphere in the air. Beautiful white 
butterflies draw wing strokes in the air as if they are symbols of a fantasy world; they delicately lead 
you into their world. If you cover the sphere with your hands to shut out the light, the butterflies 
gradually disappear, leaving silence and lingering light, bringing you back to reality. You will find 
yourself perplexed, as if you have experienced a fleeting dream. Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art

 Smoke Water Fire mark Stock Independent Artist Newton, Massachusetts USA mstock@umich.edu http://markjstock.com/ 
 Smoke Water Fire is a digital animation of a deforming blob of fluid that has been slowed down and stripped 
of environ­mental context in order to explore the shape of ephemeral media. The animation addresses several 
interrelated themes: context and speed, commonality of the equations of physics, and ephemerality of 
fluid media. It does this through its use of scale-free computational fluid physics, abstract digital 
representations, and projected moving pictures. Because of its purely compu­tational nature, Smoke Water 
Fire removes any context of material or physical scale and leaves the viewer with little more than the 
dynamics of the shape itself. Ryoko ueoka Hiroki Kobayashi The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan yogurt@cyber.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp 
hill_koba@cyber.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp Wearable Forest is bio-acoustic clothing that interacts with a remote 
forest using network technology. The intention of the project is to provide users with an opportunity 
to feel connected with nature regardless of their physical location. Wearable Forest introduces a new 
interactive sound system that creates a sense of unity between the user and a remote soundscape through 
remote-controlled speakers and microphones. Wearable Forest is conceptually based on human-computer biosphere 
interaction in that it uses wearable technology to enable bio-acoustical interaction with the subtropical 
forest of the southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The clothing uses embedded speakers, LEDs, an embedded 
CPU system, and a wireless connection to process and play acoustic data received from the forest. Sensors 
allow the user to transmit pre-recorded acoustic data back to the forest installation, creating a bio­acoustical 
loop. Wearable Forest: Feeling of Belonging to Nature  Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art | rHYtHMs

 Moving Still Santiago Caicedo L Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs Paris, France santiagocaicedo@gmail.com 
www.amak.fr tRAveRSAl as humans, our paths define our relationship with time. our daily commutes, our 
leisure activities, the floor plans of our homes, form the circuits that bring us through a series of 
successive moments to our destinations. whether on foot, in autos, or on bikes, where we are, or where 
we think we need to be, can transform our perceptions of our bodies and their surroundings. To be a 
routine traveler. No surprises at the starting point, no surprises at the point of arrival. To feel the 
monotony of a recurring journey made too many times. Looking through the window of a train, imagining 
all that happens outside, following the rhythm, and then choosing not to. Asking ourselves whether we 
want to, or if we can, still change roads. Moving Still is a stereoscopic short film that uses an experimental 
technique from a single camera shot mixed with CG elements that build and destroy the city. The film 
infuses routine travel with fantasy, challenging the monotony of our metaphorical journeys. travErsal

 Navigator Jorn ebner Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom je@jornebner.info Navigator is a Flash-based 
CD-ROM with circuitous navigation of environments, both real and representational, as its theme. At the 
end of each figurative, abstract, or photographic animation sequence, users must make choices without 
knowing where they are about to be led. The Flash animations contain abstract and figurative imagery 
combined with digital photography. Each animation depicts a navi- gation of an environment. The imagery 
is based on children s drawings and digital photographs that have been redrawn and animated by the artist. 
Users navigate with a series of buttons that lead to randomly called sequences. At the end of each animation, 
the buttons oscillate and need to be discovered. The actions in Navigator parallel the random nature

Journey Pratt Institute Brooklyn, New York USA dmoore3@pratt.edu This project examines the everyday 
journey of bicyclists and pedestrians in the New York City area by mapping their paths using data captured 
from ambient lighting conditions at various times of day. The end result is two-fold. First, a duration-based 
animation shows the cityscape over a 24-hour period, not through geographical representation, but from 
light and dark information captured by the cyclist. The second outcome consists of an illuminated glasswork 
pane that is marked with a composite of the map. The project uses light to remap space in an effort to 
re-examine familiar locations. Light plays an important role in the function of a city. Light conditions, 
whether natural or artificial, inform our perceptions and responses. By aggregating data over time, we 
transform the urban landscape into a digital painting of light.  Art &#38; Design Galleries slow art

 Forbidden City Forbidden City is an experimental animation that uses digital technologies to preserve 
traditional eastern aesthetics. In order to create an aesthetic space where history and the contemporary 
encounter each other, the animation uses two- and three­dimensional animation techniques combined with 
Chinese cut-paper design, a form of Chinese folk art. The intention is to convey the serious social and 
cultural significance associated with this highly symbolic art form. Not surprisingly, this can result 
in both conflict and dialogue. In Forbidden City, the violence in recent political events confronts the 
superficially peaceful Music by David Williams University of Massachusetts Dartmouth everyday life in 
China. As Chinese new media artists, we transform traditional Chinese artistic techniques by employ­ing

in several collective dialogues. These dialogues are between eternity and transience, oneness and variety, 
existence and emptiness. At the core of my art is an attempt to attain moments of transcen-dence, to 
reach artless-art, emptiness, self­unconsciousness, and self-forgetfulness. In other words, artistic 
creation is a process of expressing my true nature via being human.  Art &#38; Design Galleries slow

 Forbidden City Forbidden City is an experimental animation that uses digital technologies to preserve 
traditional eastern aesthetics. In order to create an aesthetic space where history and the contemporary 
encounter each other, the animation uses two- and three­dimensional animation techniques combined with 
Chinese cut-paper design, a form of Chinese folk art. The intention is to convey the serious social and 
cultural significance associated with this highly symbolic art form. Not surprisingly, this can result 
in both conflict and dialogue. In Forbidden City, the violence in recent political events confronts the 
superficially peaceful Music by David Williams University of Massachusetts Dartmouth everyday life in 
China. As Chinese new media artists, we transform traditional Chinese artistic techniques by employ­ing 
updated digital technologies. We do so in order to preserve traditional Chinese aesthetic and cultural 
values, specifically the fundamental theory of Chinese arts that says hardness comes from softness, and 
quickness comes from slowness, based on the Taoist thinking that yin and yang are complementary opposites.
