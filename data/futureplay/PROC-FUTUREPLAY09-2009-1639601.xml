		<par><![CDATA[<p>It is our great pleasure as chairs to welcome you to the FuturePlay 2009 @ GDC Canada International Conference on the Future of Game Design and Technology and to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada! FuturePlay 2009 @ GDC Canada is being hosted by Algoma University and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) at the Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, May 12-13 2009. Future Play 2009 is the place to explore groundbreaking ideas alongside some of the world's most interesting games researchers and developers.</p> <p>As with previous years, FuturePlay @ GDC Canada 2009 will focus on a number of themes. The first theme, future game development, addresses academic research and emerging industry trends in the area of game technology and game design. The second theme, future game impacts and applications, includes academic research and emerging industry trends focused on designing games for learning, for gender, for serious purposes, and to impact society. The third theme, future game talent, is designed to provide a number of industry and academic perspectives on the knowledge, skills, and attitude it takes to excel in the games industry. In addition, this year Future Play examines the world of serious games where we will examine how game technology is changing education, aerospace development, the military, health, security and many other fields. Future Play addresses these themes through exciting and thought-provoking keynotes from leaders in academia and industry, peer-reviewed paper sessions, panel sessions (including academic and industry discussions), workshops (including design, technology, and career workshops), and exhibitions of posters, games, and the latest game technologies and supports from industry-leading vendors.</p> <p>Future Play evolved from the former Computer Game Technology (CGT) Conference, initiated and presented by Algoma University beginning in 2002. Future Play is now presented annually, and brings together academics, industry leaders, government officials and students to consider new directions in computer game technologies and explore groundbreaking visions for the future of game development. FuturePlay 2009 is partnered with the Game Developers Conference&#174; Canada. GDC Canada The Game Developers Conference&#174; Canada is a collaborative forum studying the challenges and opportunities of creating games with long production cycles, large development teams, and multi-platform releases. GDC Canada will feature over 40 sessions and a keynote address from Don Mattrick, a Canadian videogame industry luminary with 25 years of experience developing the most successful game franchises in the world including "Need for Speed," "Harry Potter" and "The Sims."</p>]]></par>

The model presented in this paper is a simple and effective one that can be used to help in the design 
of games for educational purposes, as well as in evaluating existing games for their learning potential. 
Further, this model can help educators formulate strategies for using an existing game within a learning 
context. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom

...$5.00. One aspect that sets the medium of the videogame apart from other media is its highly interactive 
nature - people learn in games by doing things, and this experiential quality lies at the core of game 
design. Games provide an experience - and games designed for learning can do no less. Thus, any epistemology 
of games must begin with the experience. The author conducted an extensive informal analysis of several 
games, including: Animal Crossing Wild World and Phoenix Wright. The analysis sought to answer the question, 
How does a commercially and critically successful modern video game support the learning that players 
must accomplish in order to succeed in the game? It is known that not all learning in a game is necessary 
to win and also that sometimes learning occurs that was never intended by the designers. In the course 
of this analysis, five broad learning categories became apparent and all learning in and around games 
can be classified as (non-exclusive) members of at least one of these sets. Several visualizations of 
the relationships of these five sets were developed, and the final image ended up being somewhat bullet-shaped 
(see Figures below). Thus, it earned the moniker Magic Bullet . goal. Additionally, many games result 
in the player learning things not designed into the game (collateral learning) and sometimes they will 
learn various ways to cheat . The following sections explain these four broad categories and one additional 
one: the category of things the player actually DID learn. 2.1 Things We CAN Learn The CAN learn category 
is intended to include only those things that were intentionally designed into the game. This could also 
include the cheats that have been left in the game, but it was decided to separate cheats into their 
own category because they need to be treated separately, especially in serious contexts. The things we 
Can learn are all the things the designers put in there on purpose and includes both minor and major 
objectives. For Animal Crossing Wild World for example, it includes major things like: how to make money 
(bells), how to fish, how to make and keep friends, how to collect various things, etc. It also includes 
minor things like the fact that flowers don't need to be watered on rainy days, and that you can walk 
over a flower safely without damaging it, but running over it will destroy it. There is much there we 
CAN learn. That's the upper, bullet-shaped part of the pictures. Many games provide additional easter 
eggs , bonuses, and other elements that are not directly connected to the main game goals, though typically 
there are few if any rewards for learning many of the things in this category beyond the intrinsic satisfaction 
of having learned them. On the other hand, unless the game is designed specifically as a short form game, 
not having enough things we CAN learn is a problem, regardless of how much of that we MUST learn. Even 
if those two elements are well proportioned relative to each other: if they are too small the game will 
not be engaging. 2.2 Things We MUST Learn The elements in this category may vary depending upon the game. 
Some games allow multiple paths to the win; some games have multiple win states; some have various goals 
that can be pursued without any single win state. These things are essential to winning the game in some 
way. In a game like Phoenix Wright, there is really only one path to the win so all players must learn 
the same things (in this game they must do so in pretty much the same order too - it is essentially a 
game on rails) but many games have multiple paths to the win and/ multiple win states. ACWW doesn't have 
an actual win state, but allows you to set various goals, like paying off all of your mortgages. If there 
are multiple win states or multiple paths to the win, then the set of things a player MUST learn can 
vary and two different players learn somewhat (or radically) different things. Often though at least 
some of those things will overlap. The nature of the MUST-Learn set depends on the path or endgame the 
player is trying to achieve. With multiple paths to a single win it is possible for two players to learn 
different things and each still be able to win. The more one MUST learn of the total set, the fewer choices 
players ultimately have. If there is not enough we MUST learn in order to win, there will be insufficient 
challenge. 2.3 Collateral Learning This set includes all the things people can and do learn that the 
designers had never really intended. Without the original design documents, it is not possible to distinguish 
this kind of learning from the first category with any certainty. This set can be extremely large (infinite?) 
However, we can sometimes pick them out. For example, Tekken is a martial arts fighting game. As a direct 
result of playing this game, players may research and learn about capoeira, which is a Brazilian form 
started by slaves that combines dance, aerobics and music with mostly kicking. I'm almost certain the 
designers of Tekken did not plan that. Collateral learning also includes discoveries within the game 
that the designers did not foresee. These may be the result of deliberate design elements that combine 
with each other in unexpected ways - like being able to kill people in the SIMs by pushing them into 
pools that have no water (although, who knows, Will Wright has an odd sense of humour.) Collateral Learning 
is most often cited as a detractor by those who do not like the idea of games for education. There is 
grave concern over what ELSE students may learn and how teachers can CONTROL what students experience. 
One of the misapprehensions many teachers have is that learning in traditional settings is controlled 
while learning in games or on the web is not. Control seems to be equated with feelings of safety. Another 
potential subtext that goes with these concerns is the fear that students may learn something dark, evil, 
or otherwise bad. One way to address this is to analyse the game being used. 2.4 Cheats Cheats - One 
could argue whether or not this should be seen as a category distinct from Things-We-CAN-Learn. Cheats 
are typically designed into the game for testing purposes, and often left in the game once it ships. 
So, they are deliberate design elements on the part of the designers, but not really considered part 
of the normal gameplay. [Note: some game designers may consciously put the cheats into play by assuming 
people will use them and designing accordingly but they are rarely, if ever, *required*, so they are 
rarely part of what we MUST learn. 2.5 Things We DID Learn This category is the set of things the player 
actually DID learn. It may or may not include all the things above, but if one wants to win it must minimally 
include the set of things one MUST learn to win, at least for that sub-goal. If it turns out there is 
something one MUST learn that is not in the game that means that one must learn it from the game community 
at large. Many MMOs are like this. Some make it impossible to win things without the help of others. 
3. CONCLUSIONS The brevity of this abstract prevents a more complete illustration of this model, but 
the presentation will show numerous examples of both good and bad games as identified using this model 
as well as illustrating several variations on the model itself..

 What Really Works in Serious Games for Healthcare Education Jayshiro Tashiro, PhD, BSN, RN University 
of Ontario Institute of Technology Faculty of Health Sciences 2000 Simcoe Street North, Oshawa ON Voice: 
520.235.4383 Jay.Tashiro@uoit.ca ABSTRACT We describe recent research on learning and competency outcomes 
from work within serious games for healthcare. From this work emerged a typology for serious games in 
healthcare education. We concluded that critical deficiencies in game outcomes may lead to inadequacies 
in clinical care.  Categories and Subject Descriptors I.6.4 [Computing Methodologies]: Simulation and 
Modeling Model Validation and Analysis  General Terms Design, Human Factors Keywords Knowledge transfer, 
evidence-based learning, teaching and learning, serious games, educational games, realism, engagement, 
cognitive processing, learning assessment, competency assessment 1. INTRODUCTION Recent research has 
examined ethical issues in the roles of healthcare faculty and publishers of electronic instructional 
materials [1]. The research supporting the ethical analysis was derived from earlier studies of the impact 
of realism on the degree of end user engagement and consequent learning within serious games designed 
for educational materials [2]. More recently, a comprehensive literature review has raised concerns about 
how healthcare students and practitioners might use serious games as they try to improve clinical judgment. 
In particular, we have begun a systematic evaluation of the potential for and possible consequences in 
patient care if a serious game facilitated development of misconceptions that impaired clinical judgment. 
Our approach has been to ask how misconceptions can be transferred as incorrect knowledge after working 
within serious games for healthcare education and training. Certainly a very large and diverse literature 
converges on the idea that there are educational benefits to simulations and gaming technology. These 
benefits include: involving students in complex practice skills without risk, improved psychomotor skills,

retention of knowledge as well as enhanced decision­making skills, interactive learning, opportunities 
for replay at a particular step in a sequela as well as repeated practice of a sequela, options for immediate 
feedback, and retention of knowledge related to procedures. Some of this literature was presented in 
the report of the Summit on Educational Games sponsored by the Federation of American Scientists Federation 
[3]. Bogost [4], Juul [5], and Gee [6] also provided good reviews of extant gaming research. Work in 
healthcare has been reviewed by Tashiro and colleagues [1, 2], while the United States National Research 
Council presented summaries of research covering topics in the areas of how people learn and the science 
and design of educational assessment [7]. These works provided a useful point of departure, but have 
simplified a very large and diverse research literature from artificial intelligence, simulation, education, 
and psychology. More recent work on cognitive taxonomies [8] also holds promise for informing how and 
why to build educational games (but see points of possible opposition by Gardner [9]). A comprehensive 
review of literature from science education, nursing education, general education, and psychology reveals 
many different types of studies focused on how to help students move from novices to experts or at least 
from novices to a more knowledgeable state. Consistent with major themes within this diverse literature 
base, the U.S. National Research Council [7] synthesized a broad research literature and developed a 
streamlined list of critical issues in developing expertise. We revised this list into questions that 
we believe any set of instructional materials, including educational games, must address: (1) How do 
instructional materials enhance predisposition to learn? (2) How do the materials provide multiple paths 
for learning? (3) How does an instructional package help students overcome limitations of prior knowledge? 
(4) When and how do the educational materials provide practice and feedback? (5) Can the instructional 
materials help students develop an ability to transfer knowledge acquired by extending knowledge and 
skills beyond the contexts in which they were gained? (6) How will the instructional package incorporate 
the role of social context? (7) How and why will the instructional materials address cultural norms and 
student beliefs? It should be clear that the vast majority of instructional materials, especially educational 
games, do not address all of these questions. Key conclusions by the Federation of American Scientists 
(FAS) [3] also provided important insight into building educational games. In a 2005 summit, there was 
interesting convergence on eight conclusions reached by expert working groups: 1. It is clear that the 
modern workforces of technology-oriented countries require the skills that many video games require players 
to master. 2. Attributes of games could be useful in applications for learning (contextual bridging, 
increased time on task, improved motivation and goal orientation, personalization of learning, feedback, 
cues and partial solutions). 3. Games for education differ from games for entertainment. 4. Rigorous 
research is required to help translate the art and technologies of gaming into teaching, learning, and 
assessment systems. 5. Video game and educational materials industries are inhibited by high development 
costs and uncertain markets for educational innovations developed as learning games. 6. There are a 
variety of barriers that inhibit markets for educational games, including market fragmentation, faculty 
members and parents negative attitudes about video games, and lack of evidence for efficacy and evidence-based 
learning through gaming. 7. Educational institutions are slow to transform practices and organizational 
systems that take advantage of new technologies, including gaming and simulations. 8. There is no serious 
evidence-based learning framework that currently exists for implementing large-scale evaluations of the 
outcomes of using educational games.  FAS conclusions 4 and 8 are particularly important if serious 
games will become a part of the education and ongoing professional development of healthcare providers. 
 2. EVIDENCE-BASED LEARNING Based on research developing simulations [1,2,10-12] and an extensive literature 
review, we developed a typology of serious games that have been developed into instructional materials 
for healthcare education. This work allowed us to explore the strengths and weaknesses of serious games 
for improving clinical judgment. Specifically, we critiqued serious games now in use within nursing, 
medical assistant, and paramedic education. None of the serious games we studied met the standards for 
instructional materials defined by the US National Research Council [7] of the Federation of American 
Scientists [3]. More importantly, we were able to conduct a deeper analysis of seven research areas that 
must be studied as serious games take on a more prominent role in healthcare education: 1. Disposition 
to engage in learning. 2. Impact of realism on learning. 3. Threshold for learning. 4. Processes of 
cognitive development during knowledge gain. 5. Stability of knowledge gain (retention). 6. Capacities 
for knowledge transfer to related problems. 7. Disposition towards sensible action within clinical settings. 
 One difficulty in studying these seven research areas is that each area has embedded cognitive processes 
that are confounded across the other areas. However, as a starting point, we began looking at extant 
and proposed serious games and simulations in order to see if there was a meaningful typology of games 
that could be developed and that might serve as a framework for beginning studies on one or more the 
six critical research areas listed above. We mapped serious games and simulations into care domains such 
as Emergent Care, Intensive Care, Acute Care, Long-term Care, and Community Health. For each care domain, 
we examined the deeper structure of cognitive development from novice to expert and within each level 
of expertise, we explored achievable knowledge domains. The typology provided the first multidimensional 
map of serious games, allowing us to question if current games and simulations inculcate misconceptions 
and inadequate knowledge transfer that may impair patient care [13­15]. We concluded there is insufficient 
evidence to know if extant serious games improve healthcare education but there is evidence that they 
may inculcate inadequate clinical pattern recognition. 3. REFERENCES [1] Tashiro, J. 2009. Ethical analysis

Research Methodology; Game Studies 1. INTRODUCTION This abstract is a report on a qualitative meta-analysis 
of the methods used in choosing games for study. Game Studies continues to develop as a discipline just 
as digital games continue to evolve. While there remains an interest in examinations of specific games 
for various purposes, as the number and sophistication of titles released in a given year continues to 
rise, it becomes necessary to closely at how we are choosing the games we study, the criteria we use 
for those studies, and how we support our claims about the suitability of the game for our purposes. 
Often, studies of individual games are conducted with the hopes of being able to generalize at least 
some of the conclusions to other games and/or other players. Given the number and variety of games with 
no cleanly defined delineations of genre, can it be assumed that it is possible to examine one game and 
make generalizations to other games? Games are no longer trivial, nor frivolous so this is not a straightforward 
question. Claims that a particular game meets certain criteria critical to the analysis should be supported 
by something beyond the author s say-so. As studies on, with, and of games become more accepted and common 
in mainstream educational research, it will also become more important to justify the choices of subjects. 
This has not been common practice to date. The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine the reporting 
frequency of explanations of subject choices. Studies and reports were considered for inclusion if the 
question could be asked, Why was THIS game chosen? 2. RATIONALE Before researchers can perform studies 
using commercial games, Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal 
or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or 
commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. To copy 
otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission

...$5.00. they must choose which game or games to study. The justification of that choice is the focus 
of this paper. The field of game studies is still in the process of building academic credibility, and 
generalizability of studies is one issue that can be addressed by more rigorous justification of game 
choices. In a longitudinal study of violence in an online videogame, Williams and Skorik raised questions 
about the generalizability of games which have implications far beyond their own study. The online database 
www.allgame.com lists descriptions of more than 38,000 different games across 100 platforms. To collapse 
this wide variety of content into a variable labeled 'game play' is the equivalent of assuming that all 
television, radio, or motion picture use is the same [1]. As Dill and Dill have noted, This is akin to 
lumping films like The Little Mermaid with Pulp Fiction, and expecting this combined movie viewing variable 
to predict increases in aggressive behavior [2]. One way to interpret this statement is that by not providing 
careful rationales for our game choices, we are likely not paying sufficient attention to the great variety 
of games available. Such a large number of games means that we cannot assume that one game is as suitable 
as any other for the purposes of study. In other words we cannot collapse all adventure games into one 
category for the purposes of study. Similarly, studying ONE game does not necessarily allow us to generalize 
our findings. While a suggestion to force all games researchers to use some sort of 'scientific' approach 
to choosing games is clearly unreasonable, paying closer attention to how we choose games can certainly 
help address legitimate questions about a game s fitness for purpose in the context of a study. It may 
not be necessary to explain why someone has chosen Shakespeare or Chaucer to study, but games have not 
yet attained the level of acceptance that classic literature has and we should still be explaining our 
decisions especially if we hope to realize some findings that could be applied to some other game or 
some other population. Providing defensible rationales for game choices does not preclude the possibility 
of choosing a game because it is one we personally like, but we still need to address how that makes 
that game a worthy candidate for study. If we choose a game because it is popular, then we should be 
able to support that with facts or citations that can stand up to scrutiny. Similarly, if we claim that 
a specific game is representative of an entire genre, then it is reasonable to back that claim with further 
references. 3. APPROACH In order to report as widely as possible and since this study sought to discover 
why researchers chose the games they did, multiple publications by the same authors using the same game 
were avoided, unless that game was being used for a different purpose. Two separate analyses were performed. 
In the first, a variety papers from scholarly publications released between 2003 and 2006 that reported 
on research involving at most five distinct games were chosen. In the second papers from 2006 that had 
missed the cut-off date from the first analysis through papers published in 2008 were included. The results 
for the second analysis will be presented during the conference. Both sets of papers were examined to 
discover which games were chosen and whether an explanation or justification of the game choice was included. 
Studies featuring games like DDR (Dance, Dance, Revolution) were not included in the first analysis 
since there were so few commercial kinetic games available, a rationale is irrelevant UNLESS the study 
were looking at some aspect of the game other than its interface. Similarly, studies that focused on 
a characteristic aspect of a specific game (such as effectiveness of recruitment in America s Army) were 
also excluded. 4. FINDINGS The first meta-analysis included 52 papers that were examined in detail. 
91 games were identified comprising 71 distinct titles (some studies used more than one game but numerous 
studies used the same games such as World of Warcraft). Only one paper out of the 52 examined reported 
having applied some systematic technique to identifying games for study. Most of the papers examined 
included a synopsis of the game being studied, but only about a third (19/52) offered the explanation 
that this game met the needs of the study, and fewer still (2/52) supported that explanation with citations. 
For example, popularity is given as a rationale in 8 reports, but they do not explain how the game s 
popularity is important to the study. Obvious rationales such as we needed an MMO still beg the question, 
Why THAT MMO? Only one study described a rationale for the exclusion of one or more games from study 
[3] and one other report explained the methodology used to select the game for the study - Henderson 
[4] allowed the study participants to vote on a game, citing prior research that suggested participant 
interest was an important factor in the study s success. It is suspected that many game choices were, 
at least in part opportunistic, as the researchers had access to or were already playing this game. Only 
one researcher actually stated that they were already playing the game as their explanation for choosing 
it [5]. In three other cases, the researcher states that they have prior experience with the game but 
it is not made clear whether the study began before or after that individual began to play that game, 
nor how much influence the author s own game playing preferences had on the choice. Comments such as, 
I ve been playing this game for years places game studies in a somewhat unique position as both casual 
and avid gamers draw on their own playing experiences to help inform their studies. This kind of connection 
places many game studies in the realm of what Glesne has called Backyard Research which can make separating 
researcher roles from pre-existing ones complicated and difficult [6]. 5. CONCLUSIONS The results of 
the first meta-analysis indicate that a very small minority of game researchers currently report on the 
methodology used for the choice of a game in a study, or use examples of excluded games to support their 
choices. Very few explain how or why their stated game requirements support the goal of the study. While 
some cite references to support at least some of their claims about why this kind of game is needed for 
this study, almost none cite any references supporting their claim that the chosen game actually meets 
those requirements. By far the most common attribute supported by other references is the claim about 
the game s popularity and the most common outside reference is to sales figures. The presentation will 
report on the results from the second meta-analysis and provide a comparison of the two. Fitness for 
purpose equates quality with the fulfillment of a specification or stated outcomes [7]. If a researcher 
claims that a particular game is an appropriate choice for a particular study then it is appropriate 
to offer justification for that claim. Given the great number of games available, it is no longer sufficient 
to claim that a particular game meets certain criteria without supporting that claim in a verifiable 
way. Even though critical and commercial success are both recognizable and accepted measures of a game 
s popularity, and popularity in turn gives some indication of that game s perceived quality as judged 
by players, developers, and game critics, these are also highly subjective measures. 6. REFERENCES [1]

 Learning : : Thinking : : Playing @ Digital Media &#38; Technology PJ Rusnak Dept. of Curriculum &#38; 
Pedagogy University of British Columbia 2125 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6T 1Z4 pj@pjrusnak.com 
ABSTRACT With theoretical interests that lie at the intersection of ethics and game design, as well as 
gaming and cognition, I am currently investigating youth-driven design of digital game-play to address 
real-world issues of social justice. I respectfully welcome everyone who is interested to engage in meaningful 
dialogue about activist gaming and pedagogy [7]. In this session, I report findings of youth being@play 
with digital media and technology at 101 Technology Fun, two intensive one-week gaming and robotic research 
camps held in a technology-rich lab at the University of British Columbia. Child-technology interrelations 
are characterized according to a six-fold typology that draws from social, ethical and cognitive domains: 
recognition, feeling, attention, engagement, contact and attachment. My goal is to educe a sensitive 
attunement and thoughtful attentiveness towards understanding how youth act-in and perceive their being-in 
this milieu technique. I invite you to critically consider and to reflect deeply upon how today s youth 
are be-thinged [bedingt]: simultaneously dependent upon, inhabited by, immersed in, and indifferent to 
the digital media and technology in their lives [9]. If we take a step back and depart from our pre-determined 
views and the normative assumptions that legitimatize the already-known, might it be possible to think 
differently and to question the as-yet unimagined possibilities for technology to shape our children 
s worlds, particularly in ways that escape our scrutiny of thought? Keywords Children, youth, technology, 
design, robotics, gaming, digital media, learning environments, learning technologies, ethics, values, 
moral philosophy, pedagogy, play, education. 1. INTRODUCTION A recent review of literature on gaming 
and learning suggests that the bulk of innovative research focuses on the impact and effects of video 
game play, best educational practices or games-based learning environments [10, 14, 18]. One concern 
is a relative scarcity of ethnographies describing what youth actually do during computer and video game 
play and there is a marked need for empirical research involving children in the process of designing 
new games and technologies [6, 11, 12, 16, 19, 21]. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all

Canada. While gaming has a long history in child and youth cultures, research has only begun to build 
a theoretical understanding for the evolving dynamics of youth-driven design experiences [5, 11, 12]. 
Our need to analyze the interrelationships between digital media (most notably gaming), values and learning 
is urgent due to the scale and speed of cultural changes wherein children are now expected to engage 
with a range of technologies for educational, social and future career success [14, 20]. My research 
seeks to examine how today s children learn, think and play with ethical issues through the process of 
designing games and virtual worlds using programmable media. 2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK My study contributes 
a deeply nuanced and systematic understanding of how youth are learning within techno-cultural times 
where games are emergent and pervasive [1, 10, 18]. Informed by ethnographic [13] and phenomenological 
approaches [22], I am investigating the experiences of children designing a video game that is iteratively 
evaluated by a wide-ranging audience of their peers: 1. How does game design shape or transform children's 
learning? How does game design act as a point of entry or departure to other forms of knowledge, including: 
creative expression, literacy, identity, ethical awareness, and participatory social practices? 2. What 
forms of learning are inhabited or reinforced by the game design experience? How does the game design 
process present new pedagogies to be explored and developed?  I draw upon multiple sources of collected 
data to analyze diverse and complex forms of learning with the intent of layering findings to give visibility 
and voice to how children understand learning [2, 8, 20]. Building upon Kafai's [11, 12] and Perkins 
[16] learner-as-designer frameworks, I further develop Druin s [5] theory of participatory design within 
a technology-rich immersive space. Importantly, the theoretical focus of my study investigates: the changing 
roles of youth as learners [10]; individual thinking processes [3, 4]; distributed cognition [15, 17]; 
and how children co-create meaning, knowledge and games [2, 16]. In addition to contributing to theories 
of learning by design [11, 12, 19, 21] and to methods for researching children s cognition [13, 17], 
the results of my research will inform curriculum design and lead to practical pedagogical support for 
educators challenged to bridge digital media and technology with classroom learning.  3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Phase 1: Being@play Phase 1 was completed with the design and development of 101 Technology Fun, 
two intensive one-week summer research camps held in a technology-rich lab on the UBC campus in July 
2008. 29 children (ages 7-13 with mixed gender, ethnicity and experience) were recruited as co-researchers 
to explore gaming and robotic technologies by creating artifacts and sharing stories about their learning. 
Both child and adult authorities were involved with recording detailed field notes, videotaping child­technology 
interactions, and conducting interviews of each other. Phenomenological inquiry enabled me to gather 
evidence from which I discerned underlying patterns and structures of the children s learning, not as 
solely objective phenomena, but as lived experiences of knowledge production, communication and creative 
expression [13, 22]. 3.2 Phase 2: Design@play Drawn from Phase 1, my co-researchers negotiated the game­theme: 
imagine if we could make the world better, a storyline that rewinds back in world history to explore 
how different ethical choices might have resulted in changed life circumstances. With four teams of 6 
per team (gender specific), the children are placed in the role of game designers with real-world design 
challenges, heuristics and constraints. We will customize Storytelling Alice, a programming environment 
with a drag and drop graphical interface that allows novice users to create interactive 3D virtual worlds 
and games. Rather than present game design as an end in itself, Storytelling Alice presents programming 
as a means to the end of storytelling (this readily engages children in the design of games, made further 
appealing as Electronic Arts has contributed design elements from their best-selling game The Sims). 
 4. RESULTS: Meaning@play Phase 1 findings bring forth an understanding of how youth are being thinged 
by technological things thinging within their everyday activities of being@play. I characterize this 
child­technology interplay by a colorful and contoured description of: evocative artifacts, creative 
expressions, social relationships, bodily experiences, ethical awareness, learning practices and knowledge 
by design. Importantly, technology holds open the doorway of opportunity far and wide for its beloved 
youth to be here, there and everywhere in their chosen worlds of reality, materiality and virtuality 
redefining how, when and where children are learning, thinking and playing. I offer a generative unfolding 
of how the precious play of children s lifeworlds might go on in such a way that youth can be free to 
sojourn in an open space of destining [9] with the culturally co-constitutive technologies that are irresistibly 
and overwhelmingly tangled-up with growing-up in a technological milieu. 5. REFERENCES [1] Bogost, I.

 Distinguishing Games, Serious Games, and Training Simulators on the Basis of Intent Hannah Johnston, 
Anthony Whitehead School of Information Technology Carleton University 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, 
Ontario, Canada {hjohnsto},{awhitehe}@connect.carleton.ca ABSTRACT What s the difference between a game, 
a serious game and a training simulator? Unfortunately we don t have a zippy punch line for you, but 
in this work we present a means to segregate the three on the basis of user intent and the closeness 
to their reality, rather than the intent of the designer. We use analogies to older educational media 
and their classification to illustrate our point.  Categories and Subject Descriptors K.8.0 [Personal 
Computing]: General Games; I.6.3 [Simulation and Modeling]: Applications. General Terms Management, 
Documentation, Design, Standardization, Theory. Keywords Simulators, computer simulation games, digital 
games, serious games, educational games, learning. 1. INTRODUCTION The work of Narayanasamy et.al [1] 
provides a basis for distinguishing games and simulation games from simulators. The authors suggest that 
"the difference lies in the fact that the purpose of these processes in games is designed to be entertaining, 
fun, and engaging, while the purpose of these processes in training simulators are designed to qualify 
and track the development of specific skills in its operators." We disagree with this distinction and 
propose that the distinction be made on the basis of intent and closeness to the user s reality, as opposed 
to designer s intent. We use the analogy of books to illustrate our point. We argue this point in the 
interest of bringing parity with other instructional media formats that are currently in use. Reading 
is a pass-time that many people enjoy. Some people read historical non-fiction; others read fiction novels 
like Harper Lee s To Kill a Mockingbird . The primary goal of these readers is enjoyment, despite what 
they may learn in the process. In the educational setting, the books are used as textbooks to teach students 
about science, history, literature, and other important Permission to make digital or hard copies of

and are created for a strictly practical purpose and are typically not primarily read for enjoyment. 
The core distinction is made on the basis of intent. 2. INTENT &#38; CLOSENESS TO REALITY A reader chooses 
to read a book either for enjoyment or for educational benefit. This is not to say that the two are mutually 
exclusive, simply that the user s primary goal dictates how the book is used. If the primary goal is 
educational, it is classified as a textbook; otherwise it is classified simply as a book. Textbooks are 
further classified as manuals, depending on the materials proximity to the user s own reality. A mathematician 
who reads a math book for educational benefit may use it as a reference manual. The material in the book 
is directly relevant to his or her work and the book material is consequently extremely close to the 
mathematician s reality. The same book may be read by a student, where it is distant enough from the 
student s everyday reality for it to be classified as a textbook. A math enthusiast may read the very 
same book for enjoyment in which case it is no longer a manual or a textbook, but simply a book. The 
classification is solely based on the intent of the reader. The mathematician and student may also choose 
to read the same book with different intent. If they instead were to read the math book for enjoyment, 
we would then classify it as a book in both cases. The definition ultimately relies on the book s end 
use, not the physical book itself. Figure 1a illustrates this relationship. (a) (b) Figure 1 Classification 
of Books (a) and Games (b) A similar comparison may be made for the classification of games and as a 
result, the classification of the games is ultimately determined by the intend of the end users, not 
the designers. When the primary goal is education, it may be classified as a serious game. If the serious 
game closely resembles the player s reality, it is then a training simulation. It should be noted that 
our description of closeness to reality relates to the skills and processes required of the user and 
does not necessarily imply that a training simulation s visual appearance must closely resemble reality. 
Figure 1b illustrates the relationship between games, serious games, and training simulations. Someone 
who plays a flight simulator for fun may still learn something from the training simulation; however 
the main goal is entertainment. We classify it as a game, albeit a very expensive one. When the same 
flight simulator is used by a student to learn about piloting aircraft, we classify it as a serious game. 
A pilot might also use the same flight simulator with the objective of acquiring valuable and potentially 
life-saving skills that closely resemble the tasks they face in day to day life. Under which circumstances 
we classify it as a training simulation. Figure 2 illustrates the classification decision tree.  Figure 
2 Hierarchical Classification of Games and Simulations Conversely, a game designed primarily for entertainment 
may later be used in a serious context. For example, although the game Civilization was designed as an 
entertainment game, it has been used in the school settings to help teach history [2]. While it may seem 
obvious go classify these games based on their original design focus and content, its proper classification 
is ultimately dependent on the end user s goals and context.  3. DEFINING GAMES, SERIOUS GAMES, AND 
SIMULATORS We use the definition of a game that describes it as a closed formal system that represents 
a subset of reality. This broad definition encompasses both traditional games and video games. We define 
serious games as a subset of games used for explicit learning purposes. Training simulations are characterized 
as a subset of serious game that closely resemble the user s own specific reality. As may be evident 
from their definitions, the categorizations are not strictly separated. A blurry line of user intent 
separates the categories of games and training simulations. Our definitions of Serious Games and Training 
Simulations are built on top of the Game definition. This is consistent with our diagram in Figure 1. 
Our method of dependent definition also ensures that future developments in the categorization of games 
will not invalidate our classification of serious games or training simulations. 3.1 Goals vs. Objectives 
in Games and Simulations Narayanasamy et.al [1] proposes that one of the main distinguishing features 
of a game is the presence of goals, while simulators make use of objectives. We argue that both goals 
and objectives are present in both and that the goals may depend on the player s specific intentions. 
Simulations are often used where there exist elements of physical danger or the cost of disaster or participating 
in the actual activity for training is too high. Fire drills, CPR training, flight simulators, war training, 
and emergency preparedness are all examples of simulations. The primary goal of these simulations is 
to teach procedure while their objectives are not so easily quantifiable. Broad based goals rather than 
specific objectives are found in many simulations. 3.2 Implicit Learning in Games and Simulations Regardless 
of the player's intent, he or she may learn from any type of game. Players encounter implicit learning 
when exposed to information and consequently acquire knowledge through that exposure. On the other hand, 
explicit learning is an active process where players seek out the structure of information that is presented 
to them. Traditionally, serious games and training simulators are designed to illicit explicit learning. 
It has been shown, however, that any game may result in explicit learning if it is used in the appropriate 
learning context [2]. We also propose that any game may make use of implicit learning. Players may play 
a game for a number of reasons. If the game incorporates explicit learning, some players will manage 
to avoid it. If the game designer instead chooses to incorporate features that facilitate implicit learning, 
there is a chance that the player will learn something regardless of his or her intentions towards the 
game. The downside of implicit learning is that it is far less quantifiable. A teacher cannot guarantee 
that after playing the game, the user will have increased knowledge in any specific area.  4. CONCLUSION 
In this work we offer an alternate way of differentiating games, serious games and training simulations. 
In our view, the segmentation comes via intent, in much the same way that literature is determined as 
textbooks vs. pleasure reading. We argue that this categorization provides a number of advantages, particularly 
in defining the ideas of games vs. serious games vs. training simulations with respect to an educational 
situation. By placing games on a level ground with other classical pedagogical formats, we further legitimize 
their inclusion in the classroom. The value of the game as a classroom resource lies in its discourse 
with a qualified instructor just like any other medium. 5. REFERENCES [1] Narayanasamy, V., Wong, K.

 From Playability to a Hierarchical Game Usability Model Lennart Nacke Department of Interaction and 
System Design Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden Lennart.Nacke@acm.org ABSTRACT This paper presents 
a brief review of current game usability models. This leads to the conception of a high-level game usability 
framework model that integrates current usability approaches in game industry and game research.  Categories

we are seeing a lively debate about measures for usability and user experience in game contexts [1]. 
Admittedly, usability and playability may be dichotomous concepts [5, 7], but to understand how they 
relate to each other, we need to establish a basic taxonomical understanding of each term first. Usability 
research generally operates within the ISO 9241-11 usability standard, which defines usability as the 
extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, 
efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use [4]. This conception of usability defines 
measurable factors. This led Sauro [11] to conclude that effectiveness can be measured in completion 
rates and errors, efficiency from time on task, and satisfaction using any of a number of standardized 
satisfaction questionnaires. This puts a numerical fundament under usability studies. Following this 
argumentation, one could see digital games merely as software with the same requirements on interaction 
as other products. However, experiencing gameplay does not equal experiencing regular product use. Thus, 
assuming that playability is related to Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this

2009 ACM 978-1-60558-685-4 ...$5.00. measuring an experience, Fabricatore et al. find that playability 
is the instantiation of the general concept of usability [ ] determined by [ ] understanding and controlling 
gameplay [3]. This could be interpreted to support a dichotomy of playability and usability, saying that 
playability is related only to a game s capability to provide enjoyment for a player over an extended 
period of time [7]. Since measurable factors of gameplay are being discovered for objective quantitative 
measurement [8, 9, 13], these need to be incorporated in future playability definitions. 2. MODELS OF 
PLAYABILITY Järvinen et al. [5] establish a definition of playability for both design and evaluation: 
a collection of criteria with which to evaluate a product s gameplay or interaction . They proceed to 
introduce four components of playability derived from their take on flow in games [12]: (1) functional, 
(2) structural, (3) audiovisual, and (4) social playability, which are then analyzed in regard to formal 
aspects (game functional, e.g. rules) and informal aspects (user experience). Functional playability 
maps input peripherals to requirements of gameplay, essentially referring to the learning curve of a 
game s input/output modalities. This relates to efficiency in the standard usability definition [4], 
but refers to interaction functionalities in game context. Structural playability is an expert evaluation 
of game rules, structures and patterns as well as player evaluation of skill, experience, and actions. 
This can be compared to usability heuristics evaluation of products [10]. Audiovisual playability refers 
to the quality of the visualization and sonification of game elements. It is naturally tied to functional 
playability as interface aspects can directly relate to input controls and feedback of the game. Social 
playability estimates the suitability of digital games for different contexts of use, using a lens through 
which game cultures are examined that foster a sense of community. This aspect of playability can only 
be assessed using long-term anthropological or sociological studies. While those four components of playability 
present a general approach to evaluating game experience, only functional and audiovisual playability 
are concepts that can be quantified using metric evaluation methods. What this approach [5] lacks are 
concrete examples of empirically measurable criteria of playability. Desurvire et al. [2] present four 
game heuristic categories: game play, game story, game mechanics, game usability. The first category 
(game play) is in line with the descriptions of Korhonen s gameplay [6] and Järvinen s structural playability 
[5]. Game story certainly looks at a game s narrative development (if existent). Game mechanics are interface 
and programming rules, together with game usability, they relate to Korhonen s notion of game usability 
[6] and Järvinen s functional and audiovisual playability [5]. Korhonen et al. [6] presented playability 
heuristics modules for game usability, mobility and gameplay. Their heuristics for game usability are 
in line with what Järvinen et al. [5] call functional and audiovisual playability evaluation. The gameplay 
heuristics relate to the structural content of a game, placing them in a similar category as structural 
playability [5]. 3. A GAME USABILITY MODEL Most models acknowledge that usability is a fundament of 
playability, which leads us to propose the following model. Figure 1 shows a hierarchical game usability 
model that accounts for concrete to abstract, measurable entities, which are described from theoretical 
construct to practical application. Working technology is the foundation of any digital game and it refers 
to the quality of the system. Quality assurance for it can be done using industry standard playtesting 
and bug tracking. In any way it refers to numerical evaluations of technological functionality, incorporating 
functional playability and game usability notions [2, 5, 6]. The level of abstraction is player-focused 
evaluation, which assesses the gameplay experience using subjective and objective measures [8, 9]. It 
can be placed in the context of gameplay and structural playability evaluation [2, 5, 6]. Finally, we 
have to take into account reception and cultural significance of a game, which can also be measured abstractly 
using anthropological and sociological approaches. This correlates with social playability and is something 
that is usually rather done in research than in industry context. We will continue to expand this model 
in future research, aiming to exemplify its applicability to all phases of game development. 4. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

 1. INTRODUCTION The worldwide videogame and interactive entertainment industry revenue is expected 
to reach over $50 billion in 2009 [2]. The majority of the effort in game development revolves around 
content creation and many resources are spent on it. Game companies construct or buy a set of content 
creation tools to aid the designers in their work. However, these tools only focus on the artwork, interfaces, 
game levels, and so on but none of them really focus on the content which is related to the gameplay 
or the game story, that is, the dynamic aspect of the game. Creating this story-related content, namely 
the scripts for the behavioral aspect in computer games, and translating this into appropriate program 
code is a very difficult task. For complex scripting, the developer has to resort to manually write code 
using scripting languages (i.e. Lua or Python). Furthermore, these languages are not tailored for games 
which also do not make them easier. Over the years, game developers have come up with many predefined 
(parts of) solutions to improve the development process [1][3]. In addition, in practice, people are 
also trying to avoid writing long scripts by using existing scripts and customizing them to fit their 
needs. This brings us to the concept of design patterns, known from the Software Engineering (SE) domain 
[4]. A design pattern specifies a well-defined solution to a problem that often appears when designing 
and developing software. Design patterns allow capturing the expertise of others in a well-defined way. 
In this work, we use the concept of Generative Design Patterns [5] for specifying patterns of behavior 
that often occur in games. The use of Generative Design Patterns has the additional benefit (over traditional 
design patterns) that automatic code generation is possible. In this way they promote reuse since a pattern 
can be designed and implemented once and be used many times in different computer games and/or in different 
situations. In addition, the time of development can be reduced significantly by providing a library 
of patterns (or pieces of a solution) allowing the developer to select a pattern and fill in the details. 
These patterns can be used as first class elements in our existing visual behavior modeling language 
[6] giving us a number of extra advantages. A visual language can be very helpful for conveying Permission

and designs. It can help people to grasp large amounts of information more quickly than large listings 
of scripting code. When designed well, a visual language is easier for understanding and also for learning. 
Finally, the diagrams can also be used to ease the communication between different and non­technical 
stakeholders. The combination of the generative design patterns and the visual language provides a powerful 
mechanism to model complex behaviors for computer games as the required scripting code is automatically 
generated from these higher-level models. 2. THE PATTERN-BASED FRAMWORK We have developed the CoDePA 
framework, a pattern-based framework for specifying behaviors. This framework extends our existing behavior 
modeling approach, which allows specifying behaviors by means of a visual language. The framework (see 
Figure 1) includes two separated processes, the Pattern Usage Process (lower-left on Figure 1) and the 
Pattern Specification Process (top of Figure 1) for respectively using and creating behavior design patterns. 
 13 interactive application (i.e. computer game). The process of instantiating a behavior pattern consists 
of three steps, explained below. Each step is supported by the CoDePA Conceptual Designer tool, a diagram 
editor supporting the approach. In the first step, selection, the designer selects an appropriate pattern 
from the collection of patterns available in the library (and created earlier by a pattern designer). 
In the second step, customization, the designer customizes the pattern to the particular context of the 
game. We support two different kinds of pattern customization. A first customization is possible by giving 
proper values to parameters (overriding the default values provided for the pattern). A second kind of 
customization consists of adapting the default number of components (e.g. by adding or removing graphical 
elements) in the pattern. The third step, generation, is the automatic code generation in which all the 
specifications are translated into the actual scripting code. An example of this would be a scenario 
in which we want to have an NPC walk according to a certain path. The first thing to do is to search 
for an appropriate pattern in the library. In this case, the most appropriate pattern is the Path Movement 
pattern. Selecting this pattern will automatically drop the visual representation onto the drawing canvas 
and the designer can start customizing the pattern to the scenario. Customizing this particular pattern 
means first setting a number of parameters. Amongst the parameters, the most important ones are the interpolation 
algorithm and the obstacle avoidance algorithm that should be used. Secondly, the actual path the character 
has to follow needs to be specified since this will be different for each particular scenario. Once all 
this information is given, the actual scripting code can be generated for the character s behavior. Our 
approach also allows building new behavior patterns and adding them to a pattern library. The process 
of specifying a new pattern is divided into two steps, namely the front-end specification and the back-end 
specification. Obviously, creating a new pattern in our approach requires some knowledge of programming. 
However, most of the work is supported by means of the Design Pattern Manager tool. The front-end specification 
focuses on the aspects of the pattern which are directly visible to the user of the pattern. As the patterns 
have a visual representation, the pattern designer needs to specify this visual representation, i.e. 
the graphical elements used in this visual representation, the roles that they play, how these elements 
are connected to each other, and the parameters required. This so­called pattern definition must be given 
according to an XML Schema (available online1). Standard graphical elements, with a well-defined meaning 
are available to ease the specification and to avoid a proliferation of graphical elements. However, 
new ones can be easily introduced. Furthermore, the pattern should be described using meta-data. This 
meta-data contains information that can assist the designer on how or when the use the behavior patterns. 
The back-end specification is required in order to be able to generate scripting code. A first set of 
files to be given is the class library, which should contain code to enable the interpretation of instantiations 
of the newly specified pattern by the system. Also some templates need to be given. The templates are 
used to generate the actual scripting code. The data that will be given by 1 http://codepa.brampellens.be/PatternDefinition.xsd 
the pattern user when instantiating and customizing a particular pattern together with the templates 
will be transformed into appropriate scripting code by the code generator. All specifications in our 
approach are based on XML, and XSL transformations are used for the generation. Finally, some scripting 
code can be given which contains the actual implementation of the behavior described by the pattern or 
some helper functions. It is this code that is instantiated (i.e. invoked) or used by the scripting code 
that was generated. In the case of simple behavior patterns which are only using primitive actions, it 
is not required to provide any scripting code. 3. CONCLUSIONS The CoDePA project is elaborated in cooperation 
with a Belgian game development company. It aims at facilitating the game development process by means 
of providing generative behavior patterns. The patterns are integrated into an already existing visual 
behavior modeling language. Also a mechanism to specify new behavior patterns is provided. The behavior 
design pattern framework, implementing the proposed approach, has been discussed in this abstract. It 
allows a more experienced user to create new behavior patterns and to include them in the library of 
the framework for further use. The patterns can be used inside the visual behavior modeling language, 
developed earlier to specify behavior. The design patterns created with this framework are generative, 
which means that automatic scripting code generation for interactive applications such as computer games 
is supported. We have already applied our approach to numerous cases coming from our partner in the project 
in order to show the feasibility. However, in the future, we will also conduct experiments to evaluate 
the usability of the approach. Furthermore, we also plan to extend our pattern library with more patterns, 
especially towards smart behavior. 4. REFERENCES [1] Bjork, S. and Holopainen, J. 2004 Patterns in Game

 Game Research, Measuring Gaming Preferences Veronica Zammitto Simon Fraser University 250 -13450 102 
Avenue Surrey, BC V3T 0A3 Canada (1) 778-960-3325 vzammitt@sfu.ca ABSTRACT The development and validation 
of tools and measurements for gaming experiences is an ongoing challenge for game studies researcher. 
This paper describes a questionnaire that collects information on fine-grained gaming preferences across 
genres. The data is analyzed quantitatively. Results obtained from this tool point out to what specific 
aspects of games are preferred.  Categories and Subject Descriptors K.8.0 [Personal Computing]: General 
 Games.  General Terms Measurement, Design, Human Factors, Standardization, Theory. Keywords game preference, 
game design, game element, genre, research tool, questionnaire. 1. INTRODUCTION Game research works dealing 
with gameplay experiences have been concerned about defining variables into operationalized concepts 
in order to be able to standardize their findings. For instance, concepts as flow and immersion have 
been analyzed by translating them into galvanic skin response, electroencephalography, heart rate and 
eye tracking, and by employing subjective measures, such as oral reports [9]. However, measuring gaming 
phenomenons still lacks measurements and tools that are agreed by the academic community [7], partially 
due to the complex nature of the gaming experience, and the different methodologies employed. The main 
concepts studied in works focused on gameplay experiences are: flow [6], immersion [9], play styles [5], 
emotions [8], and fun [12]. The vast majority of researchers have analyzed the above mentioned aspect 
of the gameplay experience on a particular genre at a time. For instance, Nacke and Lindley [9] have 
worked on First-Person Shooters (FPS), whereas Tychsen et. al. [11] focused on Role-Playing Games (RPG).

@ GDC Canada, May 12-13 2009, Vancouver, Canada. Copyright 2009 ACM 978-1-60558-685-4 ...$5.00. The 
present work aims to gather data on gaming preferences across genres. A questionnaire is proposed for 
data collection which allows quantitative analysis. The goal of this tool is to understand at a granular 
level what aspects of the game are usually enjoyed by certain people. This kind of information would 
help to tailor games for a targeted audience. 2. PROPOSED QUESTIONNAIRE 2.1 Foundations The questions 
asked to gamers should be worded in a familiar way to them in order to avoid double meanings, confusion, 
and misinterpretation. At the same time, the answers to those questions should provide meaningful information. 
For these reasons, the work of Rollings and Adams on game design [10] has been selected as the foundational 
source for the construction of the questionnaire. These authors who are experienced game designers provide 
detailed descriptions of games genres. 2.2 Game Genre versus Game Element Game genres are the most used 
labels for identifying game taxonomy. When gamers discuss about games they refer to them by genre or 
by direct title comparison. For instance, stating that Command &#38; Conquer 3 [1] is a Real-Time Strategy 
game (RTS) like StarCraft [2]. Bateman and Boon [5] make an extended analysis of game genre classification 
and its relationship to play styles. Although game genres change through time, and different authors 
have different classifications, their usefulness resides in summarizing some expected characteristics 
of a game. However, it seems insufficient to identify game preferences by just referring to a genre without 
further nuance on the specific aspects. Hence, a granularity level has to be introduced. Every game genre 
described by Rollings and Adams [10][4] was analyzed, and game elements (understood as those that they 
mentioned as specific characteristic or aspects for each genre) were identified. At the same time, some 
new game elements were introduced in order to update the list; for example, rhythm being an integral 
part of the gameplay like in Guitar Hero [3]. Another adjustment done was a slight modification to the 
enumeration of genres. A total of 50 game elements and 7 genres (some of them with subgenres) were identified. 
 2.3 The Matrix All game element and genre information was condensed into a matrix. This table has game 
elements in rows and genres in columns. Some game elements belong to more than one genre. Those cells 
where an element intersects with the genre it belongs are checked and a relative weight is given. There 
are three possible weights (low, medium and high) according to how representative that element is to 
the genre. Some examples of game elements are: moving the character really fast belongs to the action 
genre (including its 3 subgenres shooting, no-shooting, and fighting) and it also belongs to the Sport 
genre. Big and complex worlds is associated to Strategy games but only to the Based-Turn subgenre, to 
the RPG and Adventure genre. Some genres have more game elements than others. This fact plus the weighting 
reveal different total values for each genre. This diversification is welcome since it allows flexibility, 
it will make possible to continue updating the matrix with future changes. For instance, by incorporating 
a new game element or a new genre if a new trend in the market appears without infringing the tally achieved 
so far. The other advantage of this model is that the importance is on the game element. A game genre 
is a cluster of game elements, it is the label to quickly identify types of games. But it is the game 
element the information to be gathered because it is the one that captures the details of what is preferred 
about games. 2.4 Validation The matrix was introduced to six professional game designers. They were 
interviewed, and asked to go over the table (while thinking aloud) making all changes that they considered 
necessary, such as modifying the relationships between elements and genres, and its weighting. Key questions 
that led the interviews were if they would approve the matrix, and if they considered that any games 
in the current market could be analyzed with the matrix. All of them agreed on approving the matrix. 
Suggested changes that were repeated by at least three game designers where introduced. 2.5 The Tool 
The questionnaire was created based on the matrix. Every game element was reformulated into a sentence 
stated in first person expressing preference or enjoyment. For instance, I prefer games where I can create 
buildings or structure that is associated to Strategy (both Turn-Based and Real-Time subgenres), and 
to Simulation (only the Construction subgenre). Another example is I enjoy leveling my character which 
is linked to the RPG genre. Players answer if the statements are true or false. If true, the game element 
is computed and the weighting is accrued to the game genre associated to it. Once the questionnaire is 
completed, it is possible to identify what are the preferences of a player with high detail. For example, 
a certain person prefers the RTS genre because specifically enjoys the game elements games with fast 
pace , game with maps to engage enemies , to conquer, explore, and commercialize , among other items. 
 3. CONCLUSION This paper has described the underlying principles of a questionnaire to identify gaming 
preferences across genres at a granular level. A refine game genre analysis was proposed in order to 
recognize game elements, since games genres are categories that are not always agreed or further described. 
Game elements were identified as the ultimate part of a game, hence a more detailed source of information. 
After the analysis, the game elements were clustered into genres with a certain weight. This proposed 
approach for understanding gaming preferences introduces the advantage of specification and measurement 
in comparison to the play styles described by Bateman and Boon [5]. For instances, their type 2 (Manager) 
is driven by strategy challenge, however this involves multiple aspects, and some of them are even opposite 
to each other such as time management (turn based or real time). The work presented in this paper deals 
with such nuances. By completing the questionnaire players reveal their gaming preferences across multiple 
genres. It is possible to know in detail what is attractive to the gamer, and if the questionnaire is 
issued to a target audience critical information can be gathered about their expectations on an enjoyable 
game. 4. REFERENCES [1] Command &#38; Conquer 3. Electronic Arts, 2007. [2] StarCraft. Blizzard Entertainment,

the Arts and Business program at the University of Waterloo, the focus of Digital Arts Communication 
300, a third-year undergraduate course, is to create an online casual game to fulfill a client-based 
need. In addition to learning the principals and concepts of game development, students are introduced 
to important business and design concepts that include the use of persona marketing, usability testing 
procedures, exploring the production of media for a specific market under specific constraints and client-based 
design. In the most recent incarnation of the course (Winter 2009), the client was the University s office 
of Marketing and Undergraduate Recruitment (M&#38;UR). The M&#38;UR office is currently beta-testing 
an online 3D Virtual Campus Tour and wishes to have games that could be associated with the various aspects 
of the Tour. These games may be discovered by a user inside a classroom in the tour and may relate to 
student campus life, or peripheral games relating to student experiences that can serve as add-on components 
to the tour. The games serve as both learning objects and advertising for the course and university.

BENEFITS OF CLIENT-BASED PROJECTS Client-based projects, that is, assignments that are provided for a 
specific audience outside of just the instructors, are common in technical communication programs but, 
it is felt, under-utilized in the Arts and Humanities and Computer Science. Client-based projects have 
many advantages over open projects. The constraints of developing something specific for a client can 
help to foster, rather than discourage creativity. We found that brainstorming without these constraints 
resulted in games that were similar to those already in existence, but with the added constraint of the 
client, student creativity flourished. Perhaps the most obvious advantage to client-based models is that 
they add realism to the classroom, which heightens motivation and can encourage ownership over the student 
s own learning processes [1]. This experiential learning aspect, it was felt, would be particularly valuable 
to students who would be searching for employment in a difficult economic period. Having the additional 
job skills of client management, persona marketing and usability testing gave these students an edge 
over their fellow student game designers. Moreover, client-based learning models help to cultivate communication 
skills, critical thinking and problem solving. 3. DIFFICULTIES OF CLIENT-BASED PROJECTS It has been 
suggested that client-based projects in the classroom are considerably more workload and require extra 
time commitment, resulting in less use of this model [2]. Notably, finding the right client can be a 
considerable time issue. However, note Lopez and Lee, sometimes clients simply fall into the instructor 
s lap. [2] It has been our experience that every time the course is taught, we have had more opportunities 
for clients than we require. There are several departments on campus, for instance, that would like us 
to develop online learning objects for various courses. Other possibilities included business contacts 
that students themselves had or could foster, and local non-profits, libraries or museums. Lopez and 
Lee provide a useful checklist to evaluate the client, since client management can become a significant 
part of the course if the client is not appropriately chosen [2]. Over­involvement or under-involvement 
can occur. The level of involvement and role that the client will play must be outlined at the start 
of the project. In this case, we met with the M&#38;UR office well in advance of the course, discussed 
their needs as well as our needs, and arranged for three points of contact with students: At the start 
of the course to introduce their Virtual Tour and their needs, half-way through the course to hear and 
give feedback on student design document presentations, and at the end of the course to provide feedback 
on student game project presentations. All students in this case had the same client, to assist the instructors 
and students in client management: With just one client, the project could become focused and any correspondence 
with the client could be first addressed to the instructors. 4. USE OF PERSONAS It would be possible 
in a class where students were already familiar with game design and persona marketing to have students 
themselves meet with a client in the first weeks of classes and develop their own persona, but as we 
were introducing them to both the concepts of game design and to personas, we constructed a persona for 
them. The course instructors met with the client in advance to develop a persona; a way of defining and 
identifying the target market. A persona is an archetypal user, or in this case, player of the game. 
Based on real data provided by the M&#38;UR group on their market high school students selecting schools 
for their university applications a two-paged persona named Sarah was developed. The instructors then 
provided the students with this persona which became an on-going touch-stone for the students to continually 
ask themselves while they are designing their game: Will my persona like this game? In the second week 
of classes, students were required to develop ideas for how they will ensure Sarah was a constant presence 
in their game design process. Some students suggested wearing a rubber-band bracelet that would say, 
What would Sarah do? Others built Facebook pages for Sarah, cut-outs of a Sarah effigy to bring to class, 
and one group even created the Sarah Stick , a cut-out pasted onto a ruler which would be held up during 
any discussions that would become the voice of Sarah. One student noted, One of the more interesting 
facts that I learned is that designers tend to design for themselves rather than their end-users or implied 
designee. The persona is a great tool to help the designer stay focused on the end-users. Another noted, 
I consider the pre-constructed persona a relief personally. I am such an indecisive person I think Sarah 
has left us with some interesting challenges too. She's clearly smart. A dumb game won't occupy her so 
the objective and rules must satisfy her competitiveness in an intelligent way. 5. GAME DEVELOPMENT 
Working in small groups, students created a design concept around the persona and pitched this to the 
client in the form of a presentation and written design document. After obtaining client feedback, students 
created a prototype level of their game for usability testing. The students were given tutorials using 
Multimedia Fusion Developer 2, a software product resembling other point-and-click programming for game 
development. Students with a computer science background or who had otherwise acquired the skills to 
program their own games were given the option of using other development software, such as Adobe Flash. 
Throughout the term, students kept an individual design blog, in which they shared their successes, frustrations, 
and ideas with fellow students, as well as discussed class lectures and readings. This was also a useful 
exercise in that the course instructors could follow student progress and ensure that they were on track. 
 6. TESTING PROCEDURES Throughout the course, students were introduced to usability testing. After learning 
about usability testing during class lecture periods, students developed their own usability questions 
to ask their small group of play-testers. In this case, other students outside of their own design groups 
served as testers. Students then undertook two sets of usability tests. Initially, they tested their 
prototype using Morae and think-aloud protocols. They identified key problems with their prototype design 
and redesigned any necessary components. Students wrote reports on their testing. One group noted, Overall, 
we found this testing phase to be extremely useful, particularly because some of these issues would not 
have been detected by our own members. After being able to probe information regarding the tester s experience, 
we learned that our game will need a challenge progression to keep the player engaged at all times. With 
this in mind, we are currently working towards adding different challenge elements to each level including 
obstacles, and varying speeds of falling objects . After developing their game, they re-tested the entire 
game on a new set of users before handing in their final project and presenting it to the clients. 7. 
ASSESSMENT Students were assessed on their participation and professionalism, documentation, design document 
and presentations, and the game project as well as smaller projects that were part of their blogs (writing 
a tutorial for the software and a game analysis). Assessment therefore included a large individual as 
well as their group components. 8. CONCLUSIONS: CLIENT-BASED GAMES It is felt that the instructors must 
play a key role in the process of client-based games, by selecting the right client for the students 
in advance of the class, and by developing a persona from which students can design their game. This 
involves somewhat more time commitment on the part of the instructors, but with positive learning outcomes. 
In summary, students in an upper-level undergraduate course have benefitted from client-based game design 
projects by supplementing game design skills with business skills, while still maintaining their creativity 
and allowing for enough time to introduce theoretical aspects of game design. 9. REFERENCES [1] Razzouk,

 Analyzing User Behavior via Gameplay Metrics Anders Drachen Alessandro Canossa IT University of Copenhagen 
Rued Langgaards vej 7 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark +004561799817  drachen@itu.dk Abstract User-oriented

user testing, computer games. The game development industry has within the past decade established itself 
as a major component of the interactive entertainment industry, rivaling the movie industry in size [1]. 
Computer games have gone from simple text-based adventures to almost photo-realistic renditions of virtual 
worlds within a variety of genres, offering a wealth of entertainment opportunities to their users. Contemporaneously 
with this development, a requirement for user-oriented testing methodologies that take into account the 
unique nature of digital games has become increasingly prevalent [9,12]. Furthermore, with the increasing 
complexity of contemporary computer games in terms of the amount of possible user actions and behaviors 
that they afford, as well as the breath of interaction options between the user and the software/hardware

Brygge 4 1354 Copenhagen K +004535375318  alessandroc@ioi.dk industry, which were adopted directly from 
productivity software testing, have come under pressure [11,13]. Game testing can generally be divided 
into technical, functional and content testing, the latter two categories involving user-oriented approaches. 
User-oriented testing is essential to game production, because the quality of the product that a game 
is directly relates to the perceived user experience. Functional and content testing are therefore two 
areas that receives an increasing amount of attention from academic and industry environments alike [e.g. 
5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,16]. The purpose of user-oriented game testing is to see how specific components of, 
or the entirety of, a game is played by people. It allows game developers to evaluate whether their ideas 
and work provides the experience they designed for. User-oriented game testing is normally carried out 
at different stages of the production cycle of digital games, which are commonly produced using agile 
methodologies. An organized, methodical approach to this work is vital, as this permits that issues are 
fixed as they arise rather than at the end of a production cycle. The requirement for improving user-oriented 
testing methodologies within game development, the increasing complexity of digital games, the variety 
of aspects of the user interaction that needs to be tested, and the requirement for methods that do not 
require long turn-around times, has resulted in a variety of approaches from Human-Computer Interaction 
(HCI) research being adapted user­oriented game testing and research [2,7,9,11,13,14]. These include 
different forms of usability testing, ethnographic methods, experience testing etc. All of these have 
specific strengths and weaknesses, but are generally useful for capturing player feedback and subjective 
user experiences; and for acquiring in-depth feedback on e.g. gameplay or design problems. However, these 
approaches are limited in that information is often hand-coded (surveys, analysis of audio-visual recording), 
meaning that getting highly detailed data about user behavior is time consuming. Gameplay metrics: Game 
instrumentation data A potential source of supplementary data to accommodate this limitation is the automated 
collection and analysis of instrumentation data, an approach utilized within the general HCI field [e.g. 
11,15], but however only recently adapted to computer game production [9,16]. Different types of instrumentation 
data can be recorded from player-game interaction. In game development, instrumentation data find uses 
within e.g. engine performance, sales across different countries or regions, project progress or user 
interaction with the game software, the latter category being of interest here. Within the context of 
user-oriented testing, instrumentation data related to player-game interaction are generally termed gameplay 
metrics [16,17], and serve to provide detailed quantitative information about the player (user) behavior. 
Gameplay metrics form objective data on the player-game interaction. Any action the player takes while 
playing can potentially be measured, from low-level data such as button presses to in-game interaction 
data on movement, behavior etc. Examples of the use of gameplay metrics include evaluating whether players 
utilize the full scope of gameplay features, if all areas of a map are explored, and evaluating game 
balance. Importantly, gameplay metrics can be utilized to discover patterns of play, i.e. if there are 
specific patterns in the way people play the game, and if these correspond to the ways intended. The 
term metric as it is used here - stems from computer science, and denotes a standard unit of measure, 
with metrics generally being organized in systems of measurement, utilized in the evaluation and measurement 
of processes, events, interaction etc. [4,10]. In general, gameplay metrics can be recorded for any type 
of user-initiated behavior where interaction takes place in or with the virtual environment; as well 
as behaviors initiated by agents or systems operating in the virtual environment outside of the control 
of the player, e.g. autonomous agents. The analysis of user behavior via gameplay metrics act as a supplement 
to the established methods for user-oriented research in the game industry and research. For example, 
usability testing focuses on measuring the ease of operation of a game, while playability testing explores 
is users have a good playing experience [11]. Gameplay metrics analysis offers however insights into 
how the users are actually playing the games being tested.  Presentation content In this presentation, 
an instrumentation-based solution to the challenge of locating methods for acquiring and analyzing detailed 
data about user behavior in computer games is presented. The approach has been formed in collaboration 
between Danish game developer IO Interactive (a subsidiary of EIDOS Entertainment), and the IT University 
of Copenhagen. The solution is presented via several different case studies which are covered in the 
presentation, based on recent major commercial games announced or published. The case studies showcase 
the strength of gameplay metrics analysis, namely the ability to provide quantitative and detailed data 
on player behavior, as well the ability to establish large datasets and mine these in order to establish 
detailed patterns of user behavior in specific contexts, thereby providing a tool for not only game development 
and design; but also general user-oriented research in interactive entertainment.  Figure 1: General 
framework for the gameplay metrics capture and analysis process at IO Interactive.  Conclusion &#38; 
discussion Gameplay metrics form a novel approach within game development and addresses one of the major 
challenges to user research, namely that of tracking and analyzing user behavior when interacting with 
the complex systems that contemporary computer games are. As a user-oriented approach, it complements 
existing methods utilized , by providing detailed and quantitative data to supplement attitudinal and 
semi-quantitative data from e.g. usability testing and playtesting [9,11,13]. Instrumentation data from 
users form an important contribution to not only user research and testing during the development phases 
of game production, but also in monitoring and evaluating user (player) behavior during the extended 
usage, i.e. during the live periods of games, where given the right tools, data can be obtained directly 
from the users operating within their natural environments.  References 1. Bateman, C., Boon, R.: 21st

 The Challenges of Game and Human Computer Interface Design for the Rehabilitation of Aphasic Patients 
 Tommy Brett Algoma University 1520 Queen Street East, P6A 2G4 Sault Ste Marie, Ontario tommy.brett@algomau.ca 
 ABSTRACT The challenges faced by the author during the ongoing de­sign and development of a prototype 
serious game applica­tion developed as part of the partnership between Algoma University and the Toronto 
Rehabilitation Institute are ex­plored. These include designing a universally accessible user interface 
operated by speech recognition software for apha­sic patients, and maintaining compatibility with the 
myriad of operating system and computer hardware con.gurations on the market today. Categories and Subject

into Gaming technology, Al­goma University entered into a partnership with The Toronto Rehabilitation 
Institute (from herein referred to as Toronto Rehab ) to create serious games focused on furthering re­search 
into rehabilitation. Toronto Rehab s goal is to ad­vance rehabilitation and enhance quality of life by 
pushing the frontiers of rehabilitation science. [6] To further this goal, Algoma University agreed to 
develop a prototype game designed to demonstrate the usefulness of gaming technology when applied to 
the .eld of rehabil­itation. The prototype game would be a digitization of an existing rehabilitation 
technique developed and proven Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work

Toronto Rehab to help stroke victims in the recovery of their language skills. The following sections 
of this paper discuss the challenges faced, and methods used to overcome them during the con­tinued development 
of The Prototype.  2. THE PROTOTYPE The partnership between Toronto Rehab and Algoma Uni­versity was 
formed in May 2008, and several months later, development of The Prototype began. Initially, conceptual 
designs were produced by Algoma University that demon­strated how gaming technology could be applied 
in a way that helped rehabilitate patients su.ering from Primary Pro­gressive Aphasia, a neurological 
syndrome without cure that causes a slow but sure impairment of the victim s language capabilities[4]. 
Adobe Flash was used to create several small semi inter­active software applications, to demonstrate 
the ease with which game concepts could be built and tested, and the broad, seemingly endless variety 
of ideas that could be ex­pressed via a digital medium. After reviewing the game ideas presented to them, 
Toronto Rehab asked Algoma Uni­versity to produce an electronic version of an existing reha­bilitation 
method developed to help aphasic patients regain their language skills. The method demonstrated by Toronto 
Rehab involved presenting a patient with a card onto which a picture con­taining an object was printed. 
Several clues were given about the object, including words it rhymed with, how many syllables it had, 
words it sounded like, and what sounds it begans and ended with. Using these clues the patient could 
attempt to solve the visual puzzle, and remember what the name of the object was, and how to speak it. 
Ideally, The Prototype would mimic this existing ana­logue memory game concept as closely as possible, 
requir­ing the user to speak the clues back to their computer in the same way they would to a therapist 
at a clinic, in ad­dition information about the user s performance would be recorded. After successfully 
completing a session consisting of a user de.ned number of visual puzzles, the user would be presented 
with a game-over screen showing them detailed information about performance from their latest session 
and also performance over the course of all previously recorded sessions. Such data was indicated as 
invaluable by Toronto Rehab in evaluating the e.ectiveness of the rehabilitation method and monitoring 
the progress of their patients. The Prototype was designed with the Universally Acces­sible Game[2] paradigm 
in mind, to provide as useful anexperience as possible to a large and varied userbase, by keeping its 
user interface simple, intuitive and instructive.  2.1 Cross-Platform Compatibility A signi.cant advantage 
of using a software application for rehabilitating a patient over a more formal therapist­patient method 
is that the possibility exists for the patient to interact with the software at their own leisure, remov­ing 
the requirement of traveling to a clinic. Furthermore, many patients reach a point in their rehabilitation 
where they wish to continue therapy in a less formal setting[1], an option that The Prototype would be 
able to provide. An immediate disadvantage to this is that a therapist who would normally administer 
the rehabilitation would not be present, and thus any relevant collectible data would re­main unrecorded. 
Clearly the rehabilitation software would have to collect the data automatically and transmit it to the 
clinic. This could be accomplished by having the application connect to the clinic via the Internet. 
Thus The Prototype would be required to run on the majority of home computer systems and have the ability 
to establish an Internet connec­tion and connect to a server. Adobe s Actionscript language met the development 
requirements, and was adopted as the language of choice, allowing any patient with a Flash sup­porting 
web browser and an Internet connection to use the application. 2.2 Speech Recognition Therapists using 
data from the completed software prod­uct would be most concerned with a patient s ability to pronounce 
a word or phrase, therefore some form of speech recognition would be fundamental to the features incorpo­ratedinThe 
Prototype. The choice of Microsoft s Speech Recognition Engine (from herein referred to as MSRE) was 
arrived at due to its ease to acquire, its cost of use (nothing for the purposes of The Prototype) and 
its presence on many home user machines as part of the Microsoft O.ce suite. After experimenting with 
MSRE, it was clear that even after hours of training, without using what Microsoft describes as an optimum 
envi­ronment[3] for speech recognition (a speci.c hardware setup which not all users could be expected 
to have) the accuracy of speech to text conversion was not acceptable, and MSRE would often convert the 
user s speech input to nonsensical words and phrases. A solution presented itself in the form of understanding 
the context of the situation within which the speech recogni­tion system was being used. In all cases, 
the application was expecting a single word stored in a database. The spelling of the word and the number 
of syllables were therefore known. Two algorithms were designed to compare input from the speech recognition 
engine with the expected answer. The algorithms included a search for substrings of the correct answer 
in the input given, and a function to calculate and compare the number of syllables in the given input 
with the correct answer. When the algorithms were combined, it was found that with some adjustment, in 
most cases the program was able to automatically correct erroneous input, providing an improvement in 
the ability of the program to detect the correct pronunciation of words by the patient. 2.3 Future Considerations 
Development of The Prototype continues, with the voice driven application control system in place, the 
current area under focus is the User Interface. Improvements are planned for its synergy with voice recognition 
as the new primary form of user input. These features include the ability to activate all UI elements 
with speech, and the restructuring of these elements into submenus. This form of restructuring will allow 
the application to better anticipate possible voice commands by understanding the context of the currently 
activated submenu. The prevailing directive while moving ahead with devel­opment will be to keep the 
user interface as simple, intuitive and instructive as possible. As discussed in [5], although aphasic 
patients vary widely in their backgrounds, they all share the common characteristic of reduced cognitive 
func­tion, including accuracy and speed of response, which must be taken into consideration in future 
design decisions.  3. CONCLUSION This paper has touched upon the challenges faced thus far during the 
ongoing development of The Prototype, has illustrated solutions to these challenges, and has shown some 
insight into the direction that the development of the project will move in. The partnership between 
Algoma University and Toronto Rehab, and the development of The Prototype demonstrate that health care 
is just one sector where a multitude of pos­sibilities exist for the application of gaming technology 
for serious purposes. 4. REFERENCES [1] S. Devlin and G. Unthank. Helping aphasic people process online

 Cognitive Evaluation of Video Games: Players' Perceptions Jayne Gackenbach Grant MacEwan College Dept. 
of Psychology; 10700-104 Ave. Edmonton, Alberta T5J 4S2 780-633-3892  gackenbachj@macewan.ca ABSTRACT 
Video games were evaluated by players very familiar with them, along five cognitive dimensions drawn 
from the PASS model. These 233 gamers evaluated up to three games each which were then placed into genres 
defined by GameSpot.com and compared in terms of their perceived cognitive components. Game genre, for 
which there was sufficient number of evaluations, differed along each cognitive dimension. Categories 
and Subject Descriptors A.0. [Conference Proceedings] I.2.1 [Artificial Intelligence]: Applications and

 Keywords Cognitive Evaluation, video games, planning, attention, physiological arousal, simultaneous 
process, successive processing, player perception, player experience. 1. INTRODUCTION A search of the 
literature found that while cognitive skills are mentioned as important to game play [6], there are no 
rating scales for games along cognitive dimensions. Virtually all rating systems focus on violence and 
sex as with other media. Within the needs of our research program [4], we are developing a scale to evaluate 
the cognitive processing demands of specific games. A fairly straightforward model of cognitive processing 
was chosen to evaluate games. This scale is based upon the model of Das [2] and is called the planning, 
attention-arousal, simultaneous and successive cognitive processing model (PASS). Johnson [5] has shown 
a relationship between subscales on the PASS and frequent internet use. However, she found insignificant 
differences in cognitive processing were most apparent between students who Matt Rosie Grant MacEwan 
College Dept. of Psychology; 10700-104 Ave. Edmonton, Alberta T5J 4S2 780-633-3892 mattjrosie@hotmail.com 
 reported frequent and infrequent recreational use of the Internet (e.g., dating, downloading music and 
videos, playing games) (p. 2098-2099). However, her finding may be in part due to the nature of her sample 
which was 72% female who generally reported never playing video games. Indeed Bowman and Boyan [1] report 
cognitive skill as related to game play, which was confirmed by Sherry et al. [5]. In this study individuals 
were asked to evaluate up to three games that they were very familiar with along the dimensions of the 
PASS. It was hypothesized that games would differ in their cognitive requirements both as a function 
of game genre and specific game titles.  2. METHOD 2.1 Participants The survey was part of the mass 
testing effort of the department of psychology at a western Canadian college. A wide variety of college 
majors are typically represented in introductory psychology classes at this school. While 394 students 
agreed to fill out the survey, only 233 actually evaluated at least one game. Participants received course 
credit for participation, but that credit was awarded whether or not they filled in the questionnaire. 
This included 101 males, 129 females and 3 with no gender information. Because up to three games could 
be evaluated 345 games were actually rated from these 233 subjects. Of these 157 games were evaluated 
by males and 182 games were evaluated by females with six game evaluations having no gender information. 
 2.2 Instrument In the first part of the survey sex and age information was gathered. This was followed 
by game play history questions. They were then instructed: In the following section, you will be asked 
to describe and rate up to three different games regarding their cognitive qualities. Please pick one 
game that you have played, and with which you are comfortably familiar (i.e., a game that you ve played 
enough to get past the learning curve, but not one in which play feels almost automatic to the point 
of boredom). Following these instructions they were asked to identify the specific game that they would 
be evaluating as well as gaming hardware and typical game play patterns with this game. Their liking 
of the game and the length of time since last having played the game were also queried. Five categories 
derived from the PASS model of cognitive skills were presented next. These were: 1. Planning: An example 
would be the strategic pairing of units in a real time strategy game, matching complementary classes 
in an MMORPG or RPG, or picking plays that complement your team in a sports game. 2. Attention: How 
much attention did the game require in order to be successful and to enjoy the game (i.e., did you have 
to pay attention to only one thing, multiple things, successive things etc.)? 3. Physiological Arousal 
(i.e. increases in heart rate, breath rate, blood pressure): An example would be heart rate increasing 
during a fighting game, a close Player vs. Player fight in an MMORPG, or a shootout in a hockey game. 
 4. Simultaneous Processing: An example would be controlling units on multiple battle fronts in a real 
time strategy, changing lines during play in a hockey game, or healing your party and attacking enemies 
in an MMORPG or RPG (can involve multiple senses; sight, hearing etc.). 5. Successive Processing: An 
example would be inputting a complex sequence of buttons into the controller to get your fighter to initiate 
a powerful combo in a fighting game, waiting for an event to occur to allow you to successfully initiate 
an action in an MMORPG or RPG, or correctly manipulating 7 steps in sequence in order to finish a puzzle. 
  It can be seen that in each of the dimensions, a definition, as well as illustrations from types of 
games, were offered. Following each cognitive skill, the participant was asked to rate how much they 
thought that skill was present in the game they were evaluating, using a seven point likert type scale. 
In each case they were also given the opportunity to explain their evaluation and to indicate how long 
it had been since they last played the game. This set of questions about game evaluations were repeated 
two more times. Thus, respondents could evaluate between one and three games. 2.3 Procedure The collected 
data was password protected through the departments research participation software and through the online 
survey site, i.e., surveymethods.com. After giving informed consent, participants filled out the survey 
in terms of one to three video games that they are very familiar with. When they finished the survey 
they were taken to a debriefing statement.  3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to identify genres in 
which games should be included, categories used on the website GameSpot.com were assigned to each game 
evaluated. Only game genres that had at least 10 game evaluations were included in subsequent analyses. 
After these criteria were met 175 game evaluations were distributed across nine genres. There were 18 
2D Platformer (i.e., SuperMario), 11 3D Fighting (i.e, Smashbrothers), 23 Ice Hockey Sim (i.e., NHL 09), 
17 Kart Racing (i.e., Mario Kart), 12 Modern Action Adventure (i.e., Grand Theft Auto), 10 Modern First-Person 
Shooter (i.e., Call of Duty), 44 Rhythm/music (i.e., Guitar Hero), 30 Sci-fi First Person Shooter (i.e., 
Halo), and 12 Sports (i.e., Wii Fit). The game example was the most frequent in the genre. Six ANCOVA 
s, with gender and length of time since the participant last played the game as covariates, were then 
computed on the nine game genres for each of the five cognitive scales of the PASS and on the subjects 
liking of the game they evaluated. Four of the six ANCOVA s were significant. Interestingly there was 
no difference in liking the game across genres. Nor was there a game genre difference in simultaneous 
processing. Attention (F(8,157)=2.116, p<.05, partial eta sq=.097), planning (F(8, 156)=2.845, p<.01, 
partial eta sq=.127), Physiological Arousal (F(8,157)=4.846, p<.0001, partial eta sq=.198), and Successive 
Processing (F(8,157)=6.957, p<0001, partial eta sq=.262) all had significant gamer genre effects. According 
to these college gamers the most attention was required by 3D fighter games followed by 2D Platform, 
Ice Hockey, and Modern Action Adventure with the least attention required to play Rhythm/Music. Planning 
was maximum for Kart Racing, Rhythm/Music and Sport and lowest for Ice Hockey and Modern Action Adventure. 
Physiological Arousal was highest for 2D Platform and Ice Hockey followed by Modern Action Adventure 
with lowest arousal surprisingly associated with sports. Finally, Successive Planning was highest for 
Modern First Person Shooter and Sports and lowest for 3D Fighter and Rhythm/Music. In conclusion, different 
genres offer different cognitive challenges to the player. These findings offer a first look into what 
is offered for the gamer cognitively as a function of genre. Data will continue to be collected until 
more information is available on more games and genres.  4. REFERENCES [1] Bowman, N. D. and Boyan,

 Real-Time GPU-Based Convolution: A Follow-Up Brent Cowan and Bill Kapralos Faculty of Business and

The generation of spatial audio is computationally very de­manding and therefore, accurate spatial audio 
is typically overlooked in games and virtual environment applications thus leading to a decrease in both 
performance and the user s sense of presence or immersion. Previous work has exam­ined the application 
of the graphics processing unit to the generation of real-time spatial audio. In particular, a GPU­based 
convolution method was developed that allowed for real-time convolution between an arbitrarily sized 
auditory signal and a .lter. Despite the large computational sav­ings, that GPU-based method introduced 
noise/artifacts to the lower-order bytes of the resulting output signal which may have resulted in a 
number of perceptual consequences. This work builds upon the previous GPU-based convolution method and 
describe a GPU-based convolution method that employs a superior GPU that eliminates the noise/artifacts 
of the previous method and provides further computational savings. Categories and Subject Descriptors

game virtual environment can contribute to a greater sense of presence or immersion than visual cues 
alone and at a minimum, adds a pleasing quality to the simulation [5]. Despite these bene.ts, spatial 
sound is often overlooked in immersive virtual environments and games which often em­phasize the generation 
of believable visual cues over other perceptual cues [2]. Fundamental to the generation of spa­tial sound 
is the convolution operation whereby .lters rep- Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or

 resenting either the response of the listener (known as head­related transfer functions or HRTFs) or 
the environment (known as the room impulse response or RIR) are used to .lter (through a convolution 
operation) un-processed sound material. However, convolution is typically performed in software and is 
thus a very computationally demanding pro­cess and except for very trivial environments cannot gener­ally 
be performed in real-time (see [4] for a thorough review of virtual audio and auralization). In order 
to take advantage of the power inherent in graph­ics processing units (GPUs), Cowan and Kapralos [3] 
pre­sented a GPU-based convolution method using the OpenGL shading language (OGLS). Results indicate 
that the method is capable of performing convolution of a .lter containing 200 coe.cients and a one-dimensional 
signal of up to 60,000 samples, in real-time (approximately four milliseconds re­gardless the size of 
the one-dimensional input signal). How­ever, the method introduced noise/artifacts to the lower­order 
bytes of the resulting GPU-based convolution out­put. This noise resulted from the limitations with the 
video card used in that work (the NVIDIA GeForce 8800). The GeForce 8800 was returning values with an 
8-bit accuracy thus not allowing images to have 16-bits per channel. As a result, the 16-bit input sound 
signal was divided into two 8-bit values (via the red and green channels of the image), combined in the 
shader and stored as .oats. In contrast to the GeForce 8800, the NVIDIA s latest video card, the GTX 
280 (which, as of writing of this paper, is the fastest single-GPU solution out there ), supports double 
precision .oating point numbers thus allowing data to be stored with full accuracy. Given the technological 
improvements of the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card and more speci.cally, the fact that it does support double 
precision .oating point operations, in this work, the previously presented GPU-based convolution method 
was modi.ed to take advantage of the double precision .oat­ing point capabilities of the GTX 280 video 
card (GPU). As will be described, not only were the noise and artifacts present in the original work 
completely eliminated, compu­tational time requirements were also reduced. 2. OVERVIEW: SHADER DETAILS 
In this section, implementation details of the GPU-based convolution method are provided. Similar to 
the previous method, the current implementation is also based on the OpenGL shading language (OGSL). 
The input (un-processed) signal can be of any type (i.e., .oating point, integer includ­ing the short 
integer 16-bit resolution common with WAV 25 .les used in many games). Of course, given an input signal 
that does not conform to this assumption, it can still be pro­cessed but at additional computational 
cost. The .lter con­sidered here is an actual HRTF .lter taken from the CIPIC HRTF dataset [1] (measured 
from a KEMAR manikin us­ing the large ear with the sound source positioned on the horizontal axis directly 
in front of the KEMAR). The .l­ter coe.cients are .oating point numbers (i.e., .oat ) and of size 200 
(although the .lter coe.cients considered here are .oating point values, the proposed method can handle 
coe.cients of any type). With the GTX-280, the 16-bit (integer) input sound sig­nal and the 16-bit (.oating 
point) .lter are both stored in single channel 16-bit intensity maps. Although this is not completely 
necessary and the data can be divided into two 8­bit channels, it does lead to reduction in both computational 
requirements and round-o. errors. A texture is then created from the data in OpenGL. This however is 
accomplished us­ing the CPU and not the GPU. To return the data back from the video card, the video card 
output must be copied from the display (screen) into arrays of bytes. These byte arrays must then be 
combined to form the desired output. In the updated GTX-280 implementation, the output must still be 
divided into two 8-bit color channels, the red and green channels, since only 8-bits per channel can 
be fetched from the frame bu.er. Although this does not a.ect accu­racy, it does require a small amount 
of processing to merge the two channels back into one 16 bit short integer.  3. RESULTS Here, a comparison 
of the computational running time re­quirements for both the conventional (software-based) and GPU-based 
convolution methods is made. This is accom­plished by measuring the computational time requirements when 
convolving a particular input signal with an HRTF for each method (the same input signal and HRTF was 
used for both methods). As described above, an actual HRTF .lter (one-dimensional) from the CIPIC HRTF 
dataset was used and the input signal was a one-dimensional sine-wave signal (each sample had a resolution 
of 16 bits and of type short int ). The size (number of samples) of the input sig­nal ranged from 5, 
000 to 60, 000, increasing in increments of 5, 000. The tests were performed using a Dell XPS 720 PC 
with an Intel Core2 6700 (2.66GHz)Processorwith2GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX graphics card 
which of course includes a programmable GPU. The results of this test are summarized in Figure 1, where 
a comparison of the computational time requirements (x­axis) vs. the size of the input signal of conventional 
CPU­based (software) convolution and GPU-based (hardware) convolution using both the NVIDIA GTX 8800 
and GTX 280 video cards is illustrated. Each point on the graph (both GPU and CPU-based implementations) 
represents compu­tational time requirements averaged over 1, 000 iterations. The GPU-based computational 
time requirements includes processing on the CPU which was performed to convert the data into the format 
required by the GPU. Although not illustrated here, a graphical comparison of the resulting low and high 
order bytes of the output of the CPU-and GPU-based convolution implementations illus­trates they are 
identical. This was also con.rmed quanti­tatively. In particular, a sinewave audio signal containing 
60,000 samples was .ltered with a number of HRTFs using  Number of Samples (Input Audio Signal) Figure 
1: Computational time requirements. both the CPU-and GPU-based convolution methods. For each case, the 
di.erence in energy between the two signals was insigni.cant. 4. SUMMARY In this paper we have presented 
a GPU-based convolu­tion implementation using the OpenGL shading language (OGLS) and the NVIDIA GTX 280 
high performance graph­ics card. Results indicate that the method is capable of per­forming convolution 
in real-time (approximately two mil­liseconds regardless the size of the one-dimensional input signal) 
thus allowing realistic spatial auditory cues to be in­corporated in to games and virtual environments.

			<par><![CDATA[<p>The use of optical motion capture systems to produce high quality humanoid motion sequences has recently become increasingly popular in many areas such as high-end gaming, cinema movie and animation production, and for educational purposes. Motion capture studios are expensive to employ or are unavailable to many people and locales. For this reason, the reuse of existing motion capture data and the resulting high-quality animation is an important area of research. Strict motion capture data restricts users to pre-recorded movement that does not allow the addition of dynamic behaviors required in advanced games and interactive environment.

 Intelligent Toolkit for Procedural Animation of Human Behaviors Paul Slinger Seyed Ali Etemad Ali Arya

arya@carleton.ca INTRODUCTION The use of optical motion capture systems to produce high quality humanoid 
motion sequences has recently become increasingly popular in many areas such as high-end gaming, cinema 
movie and animation production, and for educational purposes. Motion capture studios are expensive to 
employ or are unavailable to many people and locales. For this reason, the reuse of existing motion capture 
data and the resulting high­quality animation is an important area of research. Strict motion capture 
data restricts users to pre-recorded movement that does not allow the addition of dynamic behaviors required 
in advanced games and interactive environment. Our procedural animation method offers animators high 
quality animations produced from an optical motion capture session, without incurring the cost of running 
their own sessions. This method utilizes a database of common animations sequences, derived from several 
motion capture sessions, which animators can manipulate and apply to their own existing characters through 
the use of our procedural animation toolkit. The basic animation types include walk, run, and jump sequences 
that can be applied with personality variations that correspond to a character s gender, age, and energy 
levels. The current motion database contains a specific selection of simple animation types and variations. 
A future extension to our animation toolkit could be an increase to the complexity and number of animation 
types and variations included in the database. With inclusions of more uncommon animation types, the 
animation toolkit could also benefit from an expansion of the additional manual controls, to include 
translation, blending, and other animation options. Currently, our application is executed using Autodesk 
Maya s native language, Maya Embedded Language (MEL). Developing our application further could involve 
transferring our existing method to a designated gaming framework such as Microsoft s XNA for runtime 
execution. There are few animation systems that provide users with existing animation sequences that 
can be manipulated and updated to output a new and unique animation sequence. One current example is 
Endorphin 2.7 by Natural Motion the 3D industry s first dynamic motion synthesis software [1]. Endorphin 
uses interactive and adaptive behaviors with artificial intelligence, biomechanics and physics to create 
their animations in real-time. The software uses a standard set of supplied characters that have dimensions 
and joint limits based on anthropometric data sources [1]. The animations derived from the software are 
strictly reactive sequences resulting from the true physical interaction with the environment and physics 
based character behaviors. Although these behaviors are customizable, they lack a dimension of personality. 
Previous work in the motion capture field has been focused on overcoming the shortcomings and complexities 
of these systems. Such areas of research include efforts to retargeting motion data to new characters 
[2], motion adaptation techniques and library construction [3], and optimizing the motion capture pipeline 
for real-time applications [4]. 2 THEORY OF MOTION SYNTHESIS The output data provided by the motion capture 
system is in the form of 3D rotational angles in space which demonstrates the body poses for each frame. 
In addition to the 3D angles, a set of Cartesian measurements is also provided, showing the exact place 
of the center of the body with respect to the calibration origin. The overall complete output data is 
represented by A as shown in (1). Once both the training and test samples have been extracted, the database 
is constructed as will be explained in section 3. xyz xyz xyz 1 11 nnn .(d , d , d ) (. ,. ,. ,...,. 
,. ,. ). 111 111 111 . . xyz xyz xyz 1 11 nnn .(d2, d2, d2 ) (.2,.2,.2 ,...,.2,.2,.2 ). (1) A = . . M 
M . . xyz xyz xyz 1 n .(d , d , d ) 11 nn ). . mm (.m ,.m ,.m ,...,.m ,.m ,.m . m Different captured 
actions may vary in length (number of frames), therefore a series of time warping manipulations is applied 
to solve this problem. In simple terms, the signals for each axis of each marker are stretched or shrunk 
in time to create actions of same duration. Subsequent to the time warping process, two different methods 
were employed for re-synthesis of motion. The first methods was interpolating between existing motions. 
For instance interpolation between a high energy walk and a low energy walk results in a medium ranged 
energy walk. The other used technique was by means of generating a linear transform function between 
two existing styles of action. The transform function once applied to a new action of same class but 
different style class, will convert the style class of the action. 3 APPROACH TO DATABASE CREATION To 
begin creating a database of animated movements, it was necessary to determine the types and variations 
of animations to be included. The animations intended for the motion database include basic animations 
that are commonly used for in-game animations or simple animation sequences. Examining various game design 
documents, default animation sequences for various game engines, animation tutorials, and articles relating 
to personality and behavior provided a basis for our database. The identified animation types include 
Walking, Running, Jumping, Idling, Strafing Left and Right, Crouching, and a Collapsing or Death sequence. 
For each animation type, a secondary list of variation extremes was also identified. These variations 
add a level of personality and interest to the basic, unexaggerated animation types. Masculine to Feminine, 
Old to Young, Tired to Energetic, Happy to Sad, and Determined to Dreamy are these animation variation 
pairs. After determining the required animation sequences for the database, each sequence was captured 
using a six-camera optical motion capture system. A range of varying actors were used in several different 
motion capture sessions in which each actor performed the animation types in the style of each variation 
extreme. This collection of raw motion data was later post­processed and used in the motion synthesis 
process to produce the final database of animation matrices. 4 ANIMATION TOOLKIT Autodesk Maya is a 
node-based 3D modeling and animation software suite. Maya provides a scripting language called Maya Embedded 
Language (MEL) that allows direct access to the wide range of animation tools. This accessibility made 
Maya (and MEL) an ideal implementation platform for our procedural animation methods. The toolkit employs 
a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides users with a range of animation controls. Organized 
sequentially, the controls are presented in four steps of our procedural pipeline. Step 1 allows the 
user to select which existing character set in the scene file, if there is more than one, to apply the 
new procedural animation. The dropdown menu produces a list of all the existing character sets in the 
scene graph and choosing an option will select the desired character hierarchy to be animated. Step 2 
provides a utility to keyframe each joint for every frame, but can be optional depending on whether these 
keys already exist for the given character set. Set keys are required in order for new joint rotation 
values to be retained. Step 3 holds the primary procedures of the animation toolkit. There are two separate 
dropdown menus that can be used to select the type of animation (walk, run, or jump) and a corresponding 
animation variation (Masculine to Feminine, Old to Young, or Tired to Energetic). After selecting the 
two options from the dropdown menu, the user can use the slider control to apply a weight value between 
the two extremes of the variation. The automatic update button takes the weight percentage of the variation 
on the right-hand of the slider to the variation on the left-hand of the slider and applies it to the 
joint rotations character set, producing a new animation. Step 4, provides further control to the user 
by allowing them to apply any additional manual adjustment values to the newly animated character. The 
user can apply new rotation values and weighting for a single specific joint (or for all joints) at each 
individual frame (or all frames) by using the available controls. In addition to the four primary steps, 
the user is also presented with visual feedback and animation playback controls. These include visual 
feedback to the user regarding the current frame being processed and ultimately the total elapsed time 
for the finished process and the standard Maya playback (Play/Stop, Skip to the End/Beginning and Step 
Forward/Back a frame). Figure 2 is a screenshot of the Animation Toolkit GUI in its initial startup state. 
 Figure1: Animation Toolkit GUI Using the Animation Toolkit, a user is able to select an animation type 
and apply a range of variations in order to derive a new animation sequence. As an example, if a user 
requires a walk sequence with a more masculine distinction, the toolkit is able to facilitate this action. 
By selecting the Walk type and the Masculine . Feminine variation from the two dropdown menus in Step 
3, as well as a minimum weight value (i.e. 0.0), the resulting animation is a masculine walk cycle. However, 
adjusting the weighting to a maximum value (i.e. 1.0), results in the output of a feminine walk cycle. 
A user is able to select weight values between the minimum and maximum values that result in a unique 
mix between the two extremes. Selecting a weight value in the middle (i.e. 0.5) produces neither a masculine 
or feminine favored walk cycle, but an equal mix between the two variations. The evaluation of the toolkit 
involves (1) allowing users (animators) to interact with the GUI and provide feedback and (2) comparing 
the procedurally generated animation with motion captured ones performing the same actions. Preliminary 
results show that the toolkit can be successful in creating a range of animated behaviors with an acceptable 
similarity to motion capture data methods. 5 REFERENCES [1] Endorphin 2.7 Spec Sheet. 2008. Retrieved

 ABSTRACT Hidden Markov Models have been effectively used in pattern recognition systems in the past. 
In this work, we identify the ne­cessary elements to successfully use an HMM system for 3D ges­ture recognition 
regardless of the sensor device being used. So long as the sensor system itself is capable of outputting 
informa­tion about the 3 axes of motion (X, Y, and Z), that information can be used in this generic model 
for accurate, high speed gesture recognition. The proposed system works with accelerometer data, positional 
data and gyro data alike. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.5.2 [I nformation Interfacesand Presentation]:

, Human Factors, Theory. Keywords Gestures, HMM, Games. 1. INTRODUCTION A hidden Markov model (HMM) 
is a statistical model, initially developed for speech recognition [1]. Some current applications of 
HMMs in gesture recognition include, among others, work by Kratz[2], Kreskin[3], and Segen[4]. In a hidden 
Markov model, a sequence is modeled as an output generated by a stochastic process progressing through 
discrete time steps. At each time step, the process outputs a symbol (from a predefined alphabet) and 
moves from one state to the next state. Both actions, the transition from state to state and the emission 
of an alphabet symbol, follow probability distributions that define the model. Thus we can esti­mate 
these probabilities using a training by example process. In a hidden Markov model, only the sequence 
of emitted symbols is observed. The path of states followed by the process is hid­den from the observer. 
Given a hidden Markov model (trained by examples), M, and an input sequence S (a gesture), the standard 
question is whether S has the properties of the model M. Less Permission to make digital or hard copies

Canada. precisely: Does the input gesture look like the training gestures? To answer, we compute the 
probability, P[S|M], of an observed sequence S (an input gesture) being generated by the (trained) model 
M. The log of the ratio of P[S|M] to the probability of ge­nerating S by chance is usually used an assessment 
function. 2. Decomposing the HMM In order to remain device agnostic, the goal is to ensure that a mapping 
of sensor inputs to a common alphabet of inputs is de­manded. This may seem quite difficult at first 
glance given that different sensors will be recording different types of information that are not altogether 
related. However, given the discrete nature of any sensor, it is relatively simple to have symbols output 
based on the discrete segmentation of the sensors range. Suffice it to say, that granularity of the decomposition 
depends primarily on the precision of the sensors being used. However, it does not invalidate the model; 
rather it simply expands the alphabet. The only issue that remains is the computational requirements 
for an increased alphabet. It is also important to note that this decompo­sition requires a 1:1 alphabet 
to state. i.e. each state outputs a unique symbol. Since our gestures are in 3D space, and our sen­sors 
are emitting 3-dimensional data, we carve our space into discrete sub-cubes. In our tests, we have experimented 
with dis­crete segmentations of 3,4 and 5 subspaces in each dimension resulting in alphabet sizes of 
27, 64 and 125. Our experiments show that alphabet sizes of 27 allow real-time interactivity; the larger 
sizes are still too computationally expensive for effective real time applications. Figure 1. 7 Gestures 
2.1 Gestures in Training To record gesture data, a sensor was placed on a subject s wrist. We gathered 
and stored sensor data for the duration of a gesture performance. This procedure was repeated multiple 
times with several subjects to generate the training set. Gestures used in our experiments are shown 
below.  2.2 The Number of HMM States A balance needs to be struck between false negative results and 
false positive results in order for the system to be usable. We experimented with 27, 64, and 125 states 
in the HMM. Overall, the best results were achieved using 27 states, with the exception of the false 
positive rate which increases slightly at 27 states. This slight increase is negligible however due to 
the significant in­crease in correct classification rate attained at 27 states. This ex­periment also 
illustrates that more training samples provided will result in better recognition rates. Figure 2: Correct 
Classification Rates for 27, 64 and 125 state HMMs The side benefit of using a smaller number of states 
is that the recognition time decreases significantly. We are able to achieve 800 gesture recognition 
tests per second on a 27 state HMM (2.6 GHz processor) while the 125 state HMM runs a single recogni­tion 
task in the order of seconds. 2.3 Number of Samples in a Training Set Previous experiments have shown 
that several subjects data is required for easy replication by the general population. We con­ducted 
several experiments to determine the optimal number of samples required to generalize the gesture training 
data. Figure 3. Effect of Training Sample Size on Classification Rates for 27, 64 and 125 state HMMs 
 As the number of gesture samples increases, the curves of the graphs begin to flatten. Based on these 
results, a set of around 250 samples in a training set is a sufficient and feasible amount of data to 
collect while still providing good detection results. It should be noted that the more states the HMM 
has, the more training sam­ples are needed to achieve higher classification rates. In our expe­riments, 
since we have a real time interaction constraint, we are effectively limited to 27 and 64 states as 125 
does not compute results quickly enough. 2.4 Culling Training Data We also found that during the data 
collection phase there were a number of issues with the samples being inconsistent. For exam­ple the 
training set was created by pressing a button on the device, performing the gesture and letting go of 
the button. In this case, delays in button presses and releases inaccurately skew the statis­tics. This 
is solved by culling the input data based on sequence lengths. We throw away the longest and the shortest 
sequences. We used a 1.5 standard deviation rule to decide which sequences were to be removed. 2.5 Grouping 
Data to Lower False Positives We selected our gestures as part of a game design, rather than being arbitrarily 
chosen. This created a set of gestures that had significantly different lengths and allowed us to further 
reduce false positive rates by using a linear discriminator to first classify the gestures into short 
gestures and long gestures. Any gesture sequences with fewer than 27 elements were considered short and 
any with more than 27 were considered long. During our live testing, no long moves performed were ever 
shorter than 28 elements and only one short move (out of 70 tri­als) was longer than 27 elements, thus 
effectively removing the false positives that occurred between small and large moves. 2.6 Left Hand 
vs. Right Hand Training We conducted an experiment to determine whether gestures trained by the right 
hand could be detected if the sensor was placed on the left hand for testing. As expected, for the majority 
of gestures, the left hand tests were not recognized as valid ges­tures when compared to the right hand 
training data. This is be­cause our left and right arms have a different natural tilt to them which result 
in different sensor values when the mirrored gestures are performed. Rates dropped by more than half 
in most cases. However, some gestures that are unidirectional and involve no roll or tilt, can be performed 
fairly easily by both hands. For op­timal results in gesture recognition, it is recommended that each 
gesture for each limb should be trained individually.  3. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION We have achieved very 
good recognition rates (in the table below) using the above stated decomposition of the HMM model which 
is applicable in a sensor agnostic way. F +ve T +ve F -ve T -ve Correct In training set 11.2% 94.4% 5.6% 
88.8% 91.6% Not in training 11.4% 84.1% 15.9% 88.6% 86.4% set Table 1: Recognition results for tests 
for all 7 gestures when the person is part of the training set and not. The decomposition technique allows 
for any 3D sensing device to use a discrete HMM as part of a gesture recognition system while the speed 
allows for multiple sensors to be used together. 4. REFERENCES [1] Rabiner, L. A tutorial on hidden

Sankt Augustin, Germany david.scherfgen@h-brs.de ABSTRACT An easy to build and cost-e.ective 3D tracking 
solution is presented, using Nintendo Wii Remotes acting as cameras. As the hardware di.ers from usual 
tracking cameras, the cal­ibration and tracking process has to be adapted accordingly. The tracking approach 
described could be used for tracking the user s motions in video games based upon physical activ­ity 
(sports, .ghting or dancing games), allowing the player to interact with the game in a more intuitive 
way than by just pressing buttons. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.5.2 [Information Interfaces

s Wii game console, video games demanding physical activity from the player have be­come very popular. 
But the motion information reported by the Wii Remote controller is relative and not very accu­rate. 
This contribution explores the potential of using the built-in infrared cameras of Wii Remotes to achieve 
more accurate, yet still very cost-e.ective 3D tracking of objects or the user s motions [1]. Full 3D 
tracking can be used for creating novel gaming experiences [4]. Permission to make digital or hard copies

placed in such a way that each point in space where tracking is required can be seen by at least two 
cameras. It should be noted that the .eld of view is relatively narrow (about 45. horizontally). The 
objects to be tracked are .tted with infrared LEDs (preferably with a wide beam angle) or infrared re.ectors. 
The Wii Remote camera seems to be most sensitive to wavelengths around 940 nm. For 3D object tracking, 
the cameras need to be calibrated. Camera calibration yields intrinsic and extrinsic camera pa­rameters. 
Intrinsic parameters are characteristical constants for a given camera and describe how points in space 
are transformed to 2D image coordinates. They include the fo­cal length,the principal point (image center) 
and lens dis­tortion. Extrinsic parameters specify the camera s position and orientation in space [2]. 
Calibration is typically done by pointing the camera at a prede.ned calibration pattern (e.g. a chess 
board) and then detecting the pattern in the image. All camera parameters can then be calculated. Unfortunately, 
the Wii Remote s camera image can t be accessed directly. Camera informa­tion is limited to the position 
and approximate size of up to four infrared dots, which are detected by the Wii Remote itself. We use 
a simple calibration board with infrared re­.ectors and illuminate groups of them (Figure 1). In future, 
this will be done automatically with infrared LEDs.  3. TRACKING In the camera image, the infrared LEDs 
or re.ectors ap­pear as blobs. The Wii Remote detects up to four blobs in the image (1024 × 768 pixels) 
and returns their approximate center point position and size. The results can be queried and are then 
sent to the tracking PC via Bluetooth [3]. Given a point P , whose 3D position is to be determined, and 
its projected position P1Ion one camera s image plane, a ray can be constructed that originates from 
the camera position C1 and passes through P1I. P is located at some unknown distance along that ray. 
Once a second camera located at C2 sees the point at P2Ion its image plane, a sec­ond ray can be constructed. 
P is then calculated by .nding the two rays intersection point (Figure 2). This is called triangulation 
[2]. In practice however, the rays don t intersect, because of limited camera resolution, errors in the 
point detection pro­cess and numerical inaccuracy. One approach is to .nd a point with minimal average 
distance to all rays. The aver­age distance provides an error measure. Alternatively, one can try to 
.nd a point that minimizes the deviation that occurs when reprojecting it onto the cameras image planes 
and comparing the coordinates to the actually observed co­ordinates. Figure 2: Triangulation. Given 
the observed 2D point positions P1 and P2, the 3D point position P can be approximated. However, when 
tracking multiple points, it is not clear which points correspond to which in the camera images. This 
correspondence problem has to be solved before trian­gulation can be applied, since triangulation obviously 
relies on targeting the rays at the same point in space. Other­wise the error gets large. This can be 
exploited by testing all possible correspondences and then selecting the one that produces the lowest 
error. The brute force approach is af­fordable, since the number of points and cameras is low. In an 
additional step, the points have to be identi.ed re­liably over time. This is done by minimizing the 
distances between each point s actual position and its predicted posi­tion, which is calculated using 
its approximate velocity. 4. IMPLEMENTATION The tracking software is divided into a calibration tool, 
the tracker server and tracker clients. The calibration tool calibrates the Wii Remotes, that is, it 
calculates intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters us­ing the OpenCV library. It works for any planar 
calibration pattern, which will then de.ne the tracking coordinate sys­tem. The tracker itself runs as 
a server application. Upon startup, it reads the data produced by the calibration tool and then periodically 
queries all the Wii Remotes. The 3D coordinates for each point are determined using triangula­tion and 
.ltered for jitter reduction. Clients (e.g. games) can connect to the tracking server and receive the 
3D point positions including approximate errors. 5. PRELIMINARY RESULTS Using two cameras at a distance 
of about two meters, the precision achieved lies in the range of millimeters. This result was obtained 
by estimating the position of various infrared LED at known coordinates. The Wii Remote s tracking precision 
is convincing, con­sidering its low price. Nevertheless, the pixel positions re­ported by the hardware 
often jitter, therefore a smoothing .lter should be applied, which introduces additional latency. A 4-sample 
moving average .lter was found to be a good compromise. Due to the Wii Remotes narrow .eld of view, they 
have to be placed relatively far away from the tracking area, mean­ing that much space is required, or 
they have to be used in greater numbers. Additionally, only four points can be tracked per camera. When 
more than four points are visi­ble, it is unclear which of them will be detected. However, if a lower 
tracking frequency is acceptable, more points can be tracked by turning groups of four LEDs on and o. 
pe­riodically. This would require additional hardware for syn­chronization. 6. CONCLUSION 3D tracking 
allows for more intuitive gaming experiences and can be achieved using only cost-e.ective hardware like 
the Wii Remote and some infrared LEDs. As the blob de­tection is done in hardware, the tracking process 
is simple and doesn t need much computational e.ort. The 3D tracking system could be used in physical 
gam­ing. Re.ective infrared markers or LEDs would be attached to the user s head, hands, joints and/or 
hand-held objects, allowing their movements to be tracked. This would allow the player to directly control 
his avatar in an intuitive way, for example in .ghting, sports (tennis, bowling) and dancing games. Other 
games could recognize gestures or track the user s head in order to adjust the perspective accordingly, 
increasing immersion. 7. REFERENCES [1] S. Attygalle, M. Du., T. Rikakis, and J. He. Low-cost, at-home

 Controlling non-player characters using Support Vector Machines Pedro Melendez Algoma University 1520 
Queen Street East Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Canada pmelende@algomau.ca ABSTRACT Developing believable 
behaviours for non-player characters is an ongoing problem in the video game industry. A method to use 
support vector machines to control non-player char­acters is proposed as an alternative to classic techniques 
like .nite state machines (FSMs). Also, the method proposed is designed to be used to achieve continuous 
learning even after the game is released. Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.1 [Arti.cial Intelligence]:

Support Vector Machines, Believable Behaviours 1. INTRODUCTION The problem of controlling AI game agents 
is commonly addressed by using deterministic techniques like FSMs or scripting. Although these kinds 
of techniques are fast and easy to implement there are some undesirable side e.ects with their use such 
as behaviours being less believable and more predictable due to the deterministic nature of these techniques 
[9]. To deal with these problems, some extensions to FSM and other techniques had been proposed. For 
instance, proba­bilistic .nite-state machines (PFSMs) and fuzzy state ma­chines (FuSMs) are techniques 
that attempt to enhance FSM capabilities. Although they partially solve the problem of predictable behaviours, 
they still lack capacity to adapt to the environment. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all

 Some work has been proposed to use an arti.cial neu­ral network (ANN) as the controller of game agents 
[6] [7], proving that an ANN could control game characters in a non predictable way and generate correct 
behaviours in scenar­ios where other classic techniques are not easily applicable [3]. Unfortunately, 
in order to get a stable ANN controller, a process of several training steps and experiments is re­quired 
which is resource intensive because of the high di­mensionality of the weight space and the high number 
of local minima[8]. This results in the impossibility of contin­uing learning once the game is released 
due to the high risk of producing erratic behaviours. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are statistical 
learn­ing methods which have some properties that make them suitable to be used as controllers for non-player 
characters (NPCs). Unlike arti.cial neural networks, SVMs will pro­duce one optimal solution that maximizes 
the distance be­tween classes. That property, in conjunction with the use of cross-validation [5] to 
.nd good values for the parameters of the algorithm,o.ers a method for continuous learning; i.e. learning 
during game execution. An SVM, unlike an ANN, produces an unique optimal solution for a given set of 
parameters and training set. This makes possible reliable evolution of NPC behaviour. If a new solution 
tested in a continuous learning phase performs poorly against a valida­tion set it can be dropped in 
favour of the existing solution. With an ANN there is no guarantee that a new solution is an improvementorisevenasgood. 
Current literature about using SVMs in games is limited. Hamaide [4] describes how to use SVMs as a model 
of short­termmemory which is not quite the approach proposed in this paper but still is a good example 
of the potential use of SVMs.  2. DESCRIPTION 2.1 Support Vector Machines An SVM is a linear classi.er 
and its goal is to .nd a hy­perplane that separates the classes and maximizes the dis­tance between the 
hyperplane and the closest patterns of each class. This distance is referred to as the margin. Figure 
1 shows di.erences between the margins of two possible solutions. In cases of non-linearly separable 
clas­si.cation problems, it is necessary to map input data to ahigherdimension space where that data 
can be linearly 33  Figure 1: Decision hyperplanes Table 1: Training examples used to control a NPC

Away 10 80 2 Attack 4 80 3 Run Away 2 50 0 Explore classi.ed. The function that maps input data to a 
higher dimensional feature space is called the kernel A more detailed description of SVMs and how they 
can solve a non-linear classi.cation problem can be found in [1] and [2].  2.2 Architecture For non-player 
character control, a multi-class classi.ca­tion problem is de.ned with a high dimensional vector as input 
where each dimension corresponds to a measure for a particular feature in the environment. The output 
is de­.ned as a label that corresponds to a behaviour that the NPC should perform. Table 1 illustrates 
how this could be applied to a shooter game. Even after the SVM is trained and tested during game development 
it is possible to use it for continuous learning since SVM learning is more e.cient than ANN learning. 
In the current research project it is hoped to demonstrate that it is possible to use it e.ectively during 
pauses in gameplay, such as when a level is being loaded. SVM methods have been proposed to solve classi.cation 
problems in a systematic fashion. For instance, Hsu et al[5] proposed a simple procedure aimed at beginners 
which gives reasonable results . It is possible to adapt this method to address the continuous learning 
problem. The method proposed to achieve continuous learning can be summarized in the following steps: 
 Collect data when the game is running  In any loading stage, .nd a set of values with low train­  
ing error rate for the parameters of the algoritm using cross-validation. Train using the parameters 
found in the previous step with the original training set plus the new data col­lected during the game. 
 Test using a validation set. If the testing error is less than or equal to a constant tolerance then 
use the new SVM.  If the error is greater than the tolerance then forget the new data and use the last 
SVM.   3. CONCLUSION The pilot project currently under development uses an SVM to control an NPC in 
a third person shooter game. Continuous learning is explored in the .nal stage of the project. To validate 
results, agents using this technique will be contrasted with agents using FSMs and ANNs. Game applications 
for SVMs go beyond control of NPCs. For instance, they can be used for di.culty adjustment where NPCs 
can evolve and become harder to beat at the time that the human player is learning to master the game. 
An SVM could be used as an adjustment mechanism for helper AI agents which can learn favourite and/or 
undesir­able actions from the human player s decisions, permitting units to take independent actions 
according to the human player strategy. Also, over the shoulder helper AI agents could be able to detect 
inconvenient situations and launch a proper alert. 4. REFERENCES [1] C. J. C. Burges. A tutorial on
